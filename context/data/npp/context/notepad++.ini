# You can use the lexers that come with context and athat are meant for scite also for notepad++. On
# my machine I always install such a portable program in c:\data\system\notepadplusplus (avoiding
# funny characters).
#
# (1) Download a version of scintillua++ that matches the current version if notepad++ and unzip
#     the archive in a temporary place.
#
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\*
#
# (2) Copy these two dlls::
#
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\plugins\Scintillua++.dll
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\plugins\Config\Scintillua++\LexLPeg.dll
#
# (3) Copy this file to:
#
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\plugins\Config\Scintillua++.ini
#
# (4) Copy the files from the texmf/context/data/scite/context so that you get:
#
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\plugins\Config\data\scite-context-data-*.lua
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\plugins\Config\themes\scite-context-theme.lua
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\plugins\Config\themes\lexer.lua
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\plugins\Config\themes\scite-context-lexer.lua
#     c:\data\notepadplusplus\plugins\Config\themes\scite-context-lexer-*.lua
#
# Now you should get the standard context lexing for the file types mentioned below. I might add a few
# more (consistent) lexers. Beware: we don't use the lexer.lua file that ships with scintillua++. Among
# the reasons is that when I first played with this variant of lexing the scintillua implementation was
# quite slow, so I redid the code with some agressive optimization (in context a good test file is the
# character database file. There is still room for improvement. One problem with the lua lexer is that
# there is not much communication possible so that getting the state involves guesswork.
#
# Also, we already had lpeg based lexing in context so it made more sense to find some common ground so
# that I could share code (a bit of a hybrid approach). There are some extra features like showing
# invisible spaces and most noticeably spell checking (for more info see the manual).
#
# The lexer assumes that you have the dejavu mono fonts installed. These cover a wide repertoire of
# characters. Some features offered for scite won't be available because no additional menu items etc
# are defined.
#
# In due time some more configuration files will be added for notepad++. Maybe some more can be set up
# below.
