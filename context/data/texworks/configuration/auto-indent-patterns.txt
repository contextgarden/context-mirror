# TeXworks: Patterns for auto-indent modes

# Each entry consists of two fields:
# "name" <regex>

# "name" is a name for the mode, which will appear in the Auto-Indent submenu.
# This is enclosed in "double quotes", and followed by whitespace to separate it from <regex>.

# <regex> is the regular expression; if this matches the start of the current line when <return>
# is pressed, then the new line will be given the same prefix. The regex is not quoted.
# (Using ^ at the start of the pattern is not strictly necessary, but improves efficiency.)

# "Whitespace only"	^\s+
# "TeX comments"	^(\s+|\s*%+\s*)
