\startsection[title={closets}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem there's closets and closets \stopitem
    \startitem take the ones you put stuff in ... e.g.\ that you buy at ikea \stopitem
    \startitem you have to assemble them so you get out your toolbox \stopitem
    \startitem this kid sits next to you wondering what that tool is \stopitem
    \startitem what is natural for you to use might not be so for them \stopitem
    \startitem but grandpa likes to carry over his knowledge and experiences \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

% \startitem look at their toolbox in their garage or shed wondering \unknown \stopitem
% \startitem \unknown\ what tools their kids will keep (or even understand) \stopitem

\startsection[title={interest}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem but \unknown\ kids get their information from the internet, not from you \stopitem
    \startitem (they watch discovery channel or national geographic and know a lot) \stopitem
    \startitem or they look at vloggers (no bloggers) trying to learn something \stopitem
    \startitem and they keep moving on \unknown\ and on \stopitem
    \startitem do gp's live long tools really make sense to them? \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={grandpas}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem grandpa also has a vlogger, he is called knuth \stopitem
    \startitem gp is as locked into tex as the kids are into apps \stopitem
    \startitem he's a do-it-him-self kind of person \stopitem
    \startitem will his grandkids love watching him crafting \stopitem
    \startitem and hear his stories about meetings and journals \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={writing}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem will future generations still putting things on paper \stopitem
    \startitem just watch how handwriting evolves \stopitem
    \startitem compare todays scribbles to your grandmothers letters \stopitem
    \startitem the possibility of reuse doesn't even ring a bell \stopitem
    \startitem after all, why should they keep that text \stopitem
    \startitem eventually they will de-facebook, un-twitter and no-app \stopitem
    \startitem and who cares what get lost (most eventually gets lost anyway) \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={quality}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem say you help someone out with some graphic work \stopitem
    \startitem you send them an example \stopitem
    \startitem and then get remarks based on previewing on a phone \stopitem
    \startitem possibly with a broken screen \stopitem
    \startitem of a fuzzy backlight \stopitem
    \startitem or some blue|-|filtering going on \stopitem
    \startitem no color profiled monitors needed \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={low impact}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem going to a meeting with you is no problem \stopitem
    \startitem they are even willing to attend workshops \stopitem
    \startitem the impressions they get are great, but what was it about? \stopitem
    \startitem oh, that backslash (slanted thingie), they might recognize that (and never need it) \stopitem
    \startitem fonts, languages, clever solutions, beautiful macros \unknown\ what impresses us
               leaves no dent \stopitem
  % \startitem it all sounds polish to them \stopitem
    \startitem and let's face it: topics get weirder (much has been told by now) \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={devices}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem phones, phablets and tables .. retinal project some day \stopitem
    \startitem epub devices are accepted, probably for as long as phone battery life is bad \stopitem
    \startitem quality rendering is irrelevant \stopitem
    \startitem larger laptops are still popular but not for long \stopitem
    \startitem so in the end ... do they need typesetting at all \stopitem
    \startitem a one|-|time enforced user doesn't count \stopitem
    \startitem does \quote {installed on 3 billion devices} really impress \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

% \startsection[title={moving on}]
%     \startitemize
%     \startitem not real when no ads \stopitem
%     \startitem why should one pay \stopitem
%     \startitem how many subscriptions do you need \stopitem
%     \startitem no tv, no books, no newspapers \stopitem
%     \stopitemize
% \stopsection

% \startsection[title={throw away}]
%     \startitemize
%     \startitem we store and trust the cloud \stopitem
%     \startitem delete when space is needed \stopitem
%     \startitem loose or crash, and just forget about it \stopitem
%     \startitem one moves from phone to phone  \stopitem
%     \startitem device full, buy new, wipe old and sell or give away \stopitem
%     \stopitemize
% \stopsection

\startsection[title={future}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem accept your fate: what is current now, is obsolete tomorrow (take cars) \stopitem
    \startitem how to determine what is stable (quality) anyway (how much stayed) \stopitem
    \startitem how to locate the good in the pool of mediocre \stopitem
    \startitem how to be able to use your live long tools at work \stopitem
    \startitem just in a few generations: scratches, chisseling, scribes, monks, gutenberg, tex, ...  \stopitem
    \startitem the longer we live, the more old fashioned we'll look: we live on islands of technology \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={history cycles}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem there is this historic cycle (reinvent the wheel) \stopitem
    \startitem for instance we currently see a revival of vinyl \stopitem
    \startitem is this a side effect of crappy mp3 and/or poor digital equipment? \stopitem
    \startitem does it mean that eventually paper books will florish again too? \stopitem
    \startitem and that old fashioned rendering and printing will return? \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={consider the following}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem will superintelligence really show up soon and make all our efforts futile \stopitem
    \startitem maybe moderate artificial intelligence is already a killer \stopitem
    \startitem scifi books seldom mention reading books \stopitem
    \startitem let alone high quality typeset books \stopitem
    \startitem we have an experimental hive|-|mind outside the canteen here that we're learning to typeset a paragraph\stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={think of this 1}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem there is something called context \stopitem
    \startitem say that we want to make it popular \stopitem
    \startitem we make it into an phone app \stopitem
    \startitem that sits in its own namespace \stopitem
    \startitem but wants access to all your document \stopitem
    \startitem and your adressbook, so that we can tell your friends \stopitem
    \startitem it is free for personal use \stopitem
    \startitem but mixed with advertisements \stopitem
    \startitem and it predicts your favourite look and feel \stopitem
    \startitem of course it collects your data (for your benefit) \stopitem
    \startitem it organizes your content the way it thinks best \stopitem
    \startitem and offers you only all kind of benefits \stopitem
    \startitem and it keep buzzing and popping up \stopitem
    \startitem this is what kids find normal \stopitem
    \startitem and discard at a daily basis \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={think of this 2}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem or we can take the business view (for the old folks) \stopitem
    \startitem let's call it context professional or enterprise \stopitem
    \startitem subscription (only affordable for large companies, no simple plans) \stopitem
    \startitem support is charged per cpu / core \stopitem
    \startitem forget about the small, go 5 digit numbers \stopitem
    \startitem configurations happen via the cloud (only) \stopitem
    \startitem we use open source but don't tell that \stopitem
    \startitem we make sure we use a many page license, we share because we ... \stopitem
    \startitem we then need investors ... going big is a \quote {must} \stopitem
    \startitem so eventually we sell ourselves \stopitem
    \startitem naturally we get sold over and over again \stopitem
    \startitem and then quit and start new \stopitem
    \startitem and expect sympathy from users in the process \stopitem
    \stopitemize
\stopsection

\startsection[title={so \unknown\ grandpa}]
    \startitemize
    \startitem do we really want that kind of adapting \stopitem
    \startitem do we really expect next generations to take over \stopitem
    \startitem maybe we should keep tex in our closet \stopitem
    \startitem you don't want it to become a dirty (highway) closet, does you? \stopitem
    \startitem think different, think like kids (jc example) \stopitem
