\Topic{Development Stage}

\StartSteps
\startitemize
\startitem we started with simple usage (logos) and \POSTSCRIPT\ output \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem then we moved on to conversion to \PDF\ using \TEX\ macro solution \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem this has the advantage that fonts are handled by \TEX \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem for a long time this was a generic solution (later became the \MKII\ variant) \stopitem \FlushStep
\stopitemize
\StopSteps

\Topic{Development Stage}

\StartSteps
\startitemize
\startitem we added some extensions (transparency, cmyk, etc) and \METAFUN\ showed up \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem that extension mechanism uses special colors as signals \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem we always collected btex ... etex in order to speed up processing \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem in addition we added textext and similar features \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem communication between \METAFUN\ and \CONTEXT\ became more advanced over time \stopitem \FlushStep
\stopitemize
\StopSteps

\Topic{Development Stage}

\StartSteps
\startitemize
\startitem when \LUATEX\ showed up a substitution based lua converter was written \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem later when \LPEG\ came around an experimental lpeg converter showed up \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem some changes were made to textext processing and run management \stopitem \FlushStep
\stopitemize
\StopSteps

\Topic{Development Stage}

\StartSteps
\startitemize
\startitem the arrival of mplib had rather big consequences \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem integration of \METAFUN\ became less of a runtime burden \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem a more definitive lpeg converter was written \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem text handling was kept internal (but still needs two passes) \stopitem \FlushStep
\stopitemize
\StopSteps

\Topic{Development Stage}

\StartSteps
\startitemize
\startitem some extensions were changed to use the new pre/postscripts functionality \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem the lpeg converter was adapted accordingly \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem multiple (independent) \METAPOST\ instances were now supported \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem the chemical code was overhauled and moved to the core \stopitem \FlushStep
\stopitemize
\StopSteps

\Topic{Development Stage}

\StartSteps
\startitemize
\startitem by now all extensions use pre/postscripts \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem this made it easier to add more extend functionality \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem again the lpeg converter was adapted (simplified) \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem it became possible to do some color trickery with text \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem but (till now) color spaces are more complex (mp has a mixed model) \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem so we might move towards a slightly different approach \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem a couple of helpers were added for Mojca (some more will follow) \stopitem \FlushStep
\stopitemize
\StopSteps

\Topic{Development Stage}

\StartSteps
\startitemize
\startitem we're now splitting the code in \MPII\ and \MPIV\ code bases \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem from now on the focus will be on \MPIV \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem the (rather old) \METAFUN\ code will be cleaned up \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem where possible namespaces will be added \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem as \METAFUN\ us loaded runtime we see an impact on startup time (quite some files) \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem so maybe we will use a packed and/or zipped pseudo format file for faster loading \stopitem \FlushStep
\stopitemize
\StopSteps

\Topic{Development Stage}

\StartSteps
\startitemize
\startitem an overhaul of the flowchart code is on the agenda \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem we also want to finish (and cleanup) the chemical related code \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem simple data/graphics helpers will be provided (graph replacement) \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem and of course we keep moving on (who knows what \METAPOST\ 2 will bring us) \stopitem \FlushStep
\startitem some examples: tests/mkiv/metapost/plugins-* \stopitem \FlushStep
