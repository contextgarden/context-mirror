\subject{Presentations}

For demonstration purposes we ship some presentations. Some of these are called
up when a style is processed (in demo mode). The look and feel evolves with
\ConTeXt\ and often a style uses some trickery (\TeX, \ConTeXt, \MetaPost, \Lua\
etc.) I was playing with at that moment. The older styles therefore use more PDF
trickery than the later ones (especially because in the end the viewers were less
stable than we hoped).

Of the hundreds of presentations made so far only a subset can be found here. You
can find some more on the web (conference websites). Many presentations are
outdated but might have some historic value or show some tricks. The real old
ones are not here anyway. Some presentations build upon a previous one although I
try to avoid duplicate talks. Of course status reports can be somewhat redundant
but keep in mind that meetings are also for developers.

\ConTeXt, \LuaTeX and \MetaPost\ related presentations happened at meetings of \TeX\
user groups like TUG, NTG, Bacho\TeX, Dante, CSTUG, UKTUG, GUTENBERG, but also at
other occasions but not all make sense to collect here, if only because when they
were close in time some were similar. Also, I just deleted some sources when I
found them irrelevant for reuse. You can always report a missing one in which
case I'll see if I can find back the source. If you really want some MkII style
in MkIV too, let me know.
