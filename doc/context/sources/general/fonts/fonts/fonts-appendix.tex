\startsection[title=The \type {tfm} file,reference=fontdata:tfm]

The (binary) \type {tfm} file is not human readable but can be turned into a
verbose property list which is not that hard to understand.

\starttyping
tftopl texnansi-lmr10.tfm
\stoptyping

Here is an excerpt from the data file. It starts with some general properties of
the font. The \type {O} means that the value is in octal while the \type {R} is a
real. Keep in mind that \TEX\ has no datatype \quote {real} so internally it is
just integers representing scaled points.

A text font has the following font dimensions:

\stopnarrowtyping

Kerns and ligatures are packed into a table that is basically a sequence of
labelled entries. Here we see the entry for the character \type {f} which has
three ligatures: \type {ff}, \type {fi} and \type {fl}. Because ligatures can be
chained, octal slot 13 will have ligature entries for \type {ffl} and \type
{ffi}.

Each character gets its own entry. In this case there is no depth involved so it
is not shown. The comment is just a repetition of the entry in the ligtable.

\startsection[title=The \type {vf} file,reference=fontdata:vf]

A virtual font specification file can be converted to a more readable format with
\type {vftovp}, for instance:

\starttyping
vftovp eurm10.vf
\stoptyping

The information in a \type {vf} file will be combined with the data in the
accompanying \type {tfm} file so the output looks similar:

\startnarrowtyping
(VTITLE )
(FAMILY UNSPECIFIED)
(FACE F MRR)
(CODINGSCHEME TEX MATH ITALIC)
(DESIGNSIZE R 10.0)
(COMMENT DESIGNSIZE IS IN POINTS)
(COMMENT OTHER SIZES ARE MULTIPLES OF DESIGNSIZE)
(CHECKSUM O 24401046203)
(SEVENBITSAFEFLAG TRUE)
\stopnarrowtyping

Because this font is a math font there is no space defined.

\startnarrowtyping
(FONTDIMEN
    (SLANT      R 0.0)
    (SPACE      R 0.0)
    (STRETCH    R 0.0)
    (SHRINK     R 0.0)
    (XHEIGHT    R 0.459)
    (QUAD       R 1.0)
    (EXTRASPACE R 0.0)
)
\stopnarrowtyping

A virtual font will take glyphs from another font and therefore there are entries
that refer to these fonts. In the following definition index \type {0} is created
(the \type {D} specifies a decimal entry).

\startnarrowtyping
(MAPFONT D 0
    (FONTNAME     eurm10)
    (FONTCHECKSUM O 4276740471)
    (FONTAT       R 1.0)
    (FONTDSIZE    R 10.0)
)
(MAPFONT D 1
    (FONTNAME     cmmi10)
    (FONTCHECKSUM O 1350061076)
    (FONTAT       R 1.0)
    (FONTDSIZE    R 10.0)
)
\stopnarrowtyping

The zero indexed font is the default, so in the following entry this font is
taken:

\startnarrowtyping
(CHARACTER C W
    (CHARWD R 0.986)
    (CHARHT R 0.691)
    (CHARIC R 0.056)
    (COMMENT
        (KRN O 177 R  0.056)
        (KRN O  75 R -0.056)
        (KRN O  73 R -0.083)
        (KRN O  72 R -0.083)
    )
    (MAP
        (SETCHAR C W)
    )
)
\stopnarrowtyping

The next specification is a combination of two other glyphs becoming a new
glyph. We see here that the \type {MAP} table is actually a sort of program:

\startnarrowtyping
(CHARACTER O 200
    (CHARWD R 0.622)
    (CHARHT R 0.691)
    (MAP
        (PUSH)
        (MOVEDOWN   R -0.18)
        (MOVERIGHT  R  0.015)
        (SELECTFONT D  2)
        (SETCHAR    O 40)
        (POP)
        (SELECTFONT D  0)
        (SETCHAR    C  h)
    )
)
\stopnarrowtyping

The character information is also in the \type {tfm} companion and that is what
\TEX\ uses. The virtual information kicks in when the backend is creating the
page stream and embedding the fonts.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The \type {map} file,reference=fontdata:map]

In a map file each line maps a font name onto a file that contains the font
shapes in bitmap or outline format. For instance in the file \type
{lm-texnansi.map} we find the line:

\startnarrowtyping
texnansi-lmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmtexnansi ReEncodeFont" <lm-texnansi.enc <lmr10.pfb
\stopnarrowtyping

The backend will fetch the glyph data from \type {lmf10.pfb} and use the given
encoding file to resolve indices to glyph names. A \type {pfb} file can contain
more than 256 entries so names are used to access the data. The string between
quotes is used for the encoding vector in the resulting file.

The second entry in the line is the font name that will be used. This name is
also used to control subset behaviour. Multiple references to this name will be
collapsed into one inclusion when possible, thereby making the file as small as
possible. You better make sure that the names are unique for a specific font.

In addition to this, there can be directives for extending the font (horizontal
stretch) and transforming it into a slanted variant. Both are to be used with
care.

In \MKIV\ map files are only used for virtual math fonts and just as in \MKII\ we
load such files selectively. Users don't have to worry about this.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The \type {enc} file,reference=fontdata:enc]

For historic reasons, an encoding file is a blob of \POSTSCRIPT, probably because
it can be copied into the final output directly. Given that \TEX\ got extended
anyway, you can wonder why this information never ended up in an extended \type
{tfm} or \type {vf} file. It had definitely made the traditional process much
more robust.

\startnarrowtyping

/hungarumlaut
/ogonek
...
/ffi
/ffl
/dotlessi
/dotlessj

...

] def
\stopnarrowtyping

There are excactly 256 entries in such a vector and the names should match those
in a \type {pfb} file.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The \type {afm} file,reference=fontdata:afm]

Here we show an excerpt from an \type {afm} file that comes with Latin Modern
Roman. Just as with a \type {tfm} file we start with some general information.
However we don't need to convert the file as is it already in human readable
format.

Watch the comments! Because \TEX\ needs a couple of so called fontdimens to be
set, the comments list the appropriate values. When a \type {tfm} file is
generated from an \type {afm} file, these values have to be used.

Each character (or glyph) gets an entry. When we run out of indices i.e.\ pass
the 255 boundary (we start at 0) the index becomes \type {-1}. Only the width is
specified. The height and depth have to be derived from the bounding box for
which the specification starts with key \type {B}.

Watch how this font defines a space character and keep in mind that these fonts
date from the time that there was only one kind of space. The \type {L} entry
specifies a ligature.

The names of glyphs are standardized, and even the \type {f_k} is conforming to
standards. This standardization makes it possible to go back from glyphs to characters
when copying text from a typeset document.

The kern table is pretty large here and for a reason. First of all the file
defines 821 glyphs so the average amount of kerns per glyph is not that large.
But take a look at the \type {A}. Because the \type {Aacute} has the same shape
it kerns in a similar way. This means that ideally all combined characters end up
with the same value as their base glyph. However, in our case a bit more
selective approach is taken. The \type {Adieresis} has a different set of kerns,
probably to save space. It is for this reason that \OPENTYPE\ fonts have a model
of kern classes so that similar shapes can be treated as one when setting kerns.
You see a similar issue with ligatures, where often the right part of the shape
kerns the same as the (stand alone) first part of the shape does.

If you look closely at the names, you will notice that some glyphs have a
variant. In \OPENTYPE\ fonts these variants are grouped in features like \type
{oldstyle}. The first part of such a name is still part of the standardization,
but the second part is up to the font designer.

\startsection[title=The \type {otf} file,reference=fontdata:otf]

In the \LUATEX\ manual you can find an overview of the raw \OTF\ format as
exposed in a \LUA\ table. The first decade of \LUATEX\ we used the built|-|in
loader but even then in \CONTEXT\ we didn't use that format directly but used it
to create a more compact and efficient table instead. The current release of
\CONTEXT\ uses its own loader written in \LUA, but the fundamentals have not
changed much. The tables are cached and can be read in at high speed. The
structure of the tables is unlikely to change much although more data might get
added. Although you can access the data it seldom makes sense to do so. Where
needed interfaces are provided.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The \type {lfg} file,reference=fontdata:lua]

We use the goodies file control what gets added, replaced, patched or manipulated
in a font. A goodie file permits us to go beyond what font provide by default.
The content of a goodie file differs per font. As we also use this for
experiments, not all entries that you find in such files are meant for users.
