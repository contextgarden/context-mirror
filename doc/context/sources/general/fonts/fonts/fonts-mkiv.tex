% comment   : Because this manual is distributed with TeX distributions it comes with a rather
%             liberal license. We try to adapt these documents to upgrades in the (sub)systems
%             that they describe. Using parts of the content otherwise can therefore conflict
%             with existing functionality and we cannot be held responsible for that. Many of
%             the manuals contain characteristic graphics and personal notes or examples that
%             make no sense when used out-of-context.

% comment   : Some chapters might have been published in TugBoat, the NTG Maps, the ConTeXt
%             Group journal or otherwise. Thanks to the editors for corrections. Also thanks
%             to users for testing, feedback and corrections.

\startbuffer[abstract]

    This book is about fonts and how they are dealt with in \CONTEXT\ \MKIV\ and
    \LUATEX. Although we use \CONTEXT\ as starting point, much applies to the
    generic font handler that ships as part of this macro package. We discuss the
    way fonts are dealt with in the engine, font formats, standard features and
    additional goodies. Tracing and the extensibility of code are also discussed.
    This book is the more technical companion of the regular \CONTEXT\ font
    manual.
