This is the zero issue of a range of \CONTEXT\ related publications, in most
cases short introductions to new functionality. The style may be used by users
for providing similar documents, but preferably not for other purposes, since it
may confuse readers in their expectations.

We've chosen a layout which is more functional than beautiful. This layout
provides several text areas: headers and footers, margins and edges as well as a
main text area. The surrounding (gray or color) makes the main page (which is
slightly smaller than A4) stand out and is suitable for viewing in spread mode.

The documents produced at \PRAGMA\ are called {\bf This Way}, user documents gets
the title {\bf My Way}. The \PRAGMA\ issues are numbered. We strongly advise you
not to use the \type {mag-} prefix for your issues, since this may lead to
clashes with files distributed by \PRAGMA.
