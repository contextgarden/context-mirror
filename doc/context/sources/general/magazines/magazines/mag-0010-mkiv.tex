    The content of tenth magazine was written while listening to Tori Amos'
    latest album, The Beekeeper. In the (nice) booklet the text flows in shapes
    and here I will demonstrate that \TEX\ can do something similar. It's also a
    nice example of applying \HZ\ optimization.

  [title={Good looking shapes},

   affiliation=PRAGMA ADE,

   number=10 \MKIV]

Just as it takes while to get an understanding what \TEX\ is about, it takes a
couple of listening loops to get a general picture about Tori Amos' Beekeeper.
While browsing the rather nicely designed booklet I got puzzled |<|as usual when
seeing such nice book(let)s|>| why everything looked okay except the text. High
end design combined with rather low end typography. Don't get me wrong, apart
from the typesetting it's a pretty good product! Tori being one of my favourite
artists, you can imagine that I wrote quite some \CONTEXT\ code listening to her
music.

Now I will not argue that \TEX\ (or \CONTEXT) is the proper system for making
\CD\ covers, but since most of such a booklet is a matter of pasting graphics
components together, I can imagine that one should ask someone to typeset the
text snippets using a proper engine. Anyway, most buyers (fans) won't notice it,
but anyone familiar with \TEX\ will immediate get distracted by the strange
intercharacter and interline spacing.

Typesetting in a fixed shape is non||trivial. First of all lines should break in
a pleasing way. If possible, hyphenation should be avoided. The gaps between
characters must not become to large and the last line should not be too short.
Doing this in \TEX\ is non trivial either, not so much because \TEX\ cannot do
such things, but because one needs to control several mechanisms at once. On the
other hand, one should know what one's dealing with anyway.

Because the size of the shape is fixed, we can manipulate the number of lines
and/or the line length and scale afterwards to the desired size. The font size is
not fixed. This permits us to implement a semi||automated solution. The
difference between the first version of the solution and current one is that we
take into account an odd|/|even number of lines. Also, finding the best exit
condition took some experiments. The final solution is not that complex and also
shows a couple of tricks.

\startuniqueMPgraphic{beecell}{offset,color}

    for i = 1 upto 6 : (0,OverlayHeight/2)
      rotatedaround (center OverlayBox,i*60) --
    endfor cycle
    withpen pencircle scaled \MPvar{offset}
    withcolor \MPvar{color} ;
\stopuniqueMPgraphic

\getbuffer

The shape we are dealing with looks as follows:

\startlinecorrection
\startMPcode
  fill
    for i = 1 upto 6 : (5cm,0)
      rotatedaround(origin,i*60) --
    endfor cycle
    withpen pencircle scaled 2mm
    withcolor \MPcolor{BeeColorC} ;
  currentpicture := currentpicture xsized(5cm) ;
\stopMPcode
\stoplinecorrection

We will will later put such a shape behind the text for which we define an
overlay:

\typebuffer

Normally one will not put a shape behind the text, but in our case it illustrates
the idea. We use an offset in order to get a more pleasing look.

We will use the following two sample texts. The original linebreaks are visible
in the source:

\typebuffer \getbuffer

We will call these buffers indirectly (using setups is a convenient way to
collect commands and definitions).

\typebuffer \getbuffer

Now comes the dirty code. We assume that you know a bit of \CONTEXT. First of all
we choose a font, in our case a Termes for the running text. We will use
Hermann Zapf optimization, which is way more acceptable that intercharacter
spacing and gives quite good results here.

\startbuffer
\definefontfeature[hzdefault][default][hz=quality]
\definefont[BeeFont][file:texgyre-termes*hzdefault]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

The core of the code is a loop wherein we try to figure out what the best width
is. In principle this method can be used for similar shapes. Beforehand we define
a few variables.

\startbuffer
\cldcontext{math.cosd(60)}
\cldcontext{math.sind(60)}

\newdimen\BeeEdge
\newdimen\BeeLine
\newdimen\BeeSize

\newbox  \BeeBox

\def\BeeLines{17}   % choose optimum odd/even
\def\BeeStart{2cm}  % set automatically
\def\BeeStep {.5mm} % accurate enough
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

The loop starts with a rather small width and with increasing steps tries to find
the solution where the number of used lines equals the asked number of lines. We
could have used low level \TEX\ primitives, but using a few \CONTEXT\ wrappers
makes more sense because that way struts and alike are set as well. In the end we
stretch the interline spacing to match the height of the cell.

The end criterium is determined by:

\startbuffer
\def\CheckBeeLines
  {\ifnum\BeeTotal>\BeeLines\relax
     \donefalse
   \else
     \donetrue
   \fi}
\stopbuffer

\getbuffer \typebuffer

This solution is rather safe and, at the cost of the ugly saving of the number of
lines as registered in \type {\prevgraf}, works better than measuring the height
of the box.

We could build the loop out of more isolated pieces of code like this but the
reason why we do it for the checker is that we now can redefine it. At the cost
of a few more tests, the following checker is better, because it goes on for a
while and keeps looking for better solutions. If you have no idea what badness
is, just skip the following code snippet.

\startbuffer
\def\CheckBeeLines
  {\ifnum\BeeTotal>\BeeLines\relax
     \donefalse
   \else\ifnum\BeeTotal=\BeeLines\relax
     \ifnum\BeeRate=\zerocount
       \global\setbox\BeeBox=\box\scratchbox
       \donetrue
     \else\ifnum\BeeRate<\BeeMax\relax
       \global\let\BeeMax\BeeRate
       \global\setbox\BeeBox=\box\scratchbox
       \donefalse
     \else
       \donefalse
     \fi\fi
   \else
     \donetrue
   \fi\fi}
\stopbuffer

\getbuffer \typebuffer

Well, this is not the kind of code you want a designer to enter, but providing it
as feature in a desk top publishing application is also non||trivial because each
case differs and turning many knobs to get things done is not easy either, so
basically it comes down to manual work (neglectable to the total amount of work
involved in getting such a musical product done). Of course one can ask someone
to typeset the text in \TEX\ and provide it as image, but that would make
coordination the production more complex.

The criterium (here \BeeStep) can be made smaller when you encounter problems. If
we set it to 1mm, we get one case where the amount of lines jumps~2 and the loop
is exit unexpected. Of course one can catch such cases but it does not make much
sense in such a one||shot macro.

The previous setup is applied as follows:

\startbuffer
\startsetups beeloner
  \framed
    [offset=overlay,
     frame=off,
     background=beecell,
     foregroundstyle=\BeeFont]
    {\setups[beeloop]}
\stopsetups

We will now put several variants alongside. For this we use a layer:

\startbuffer
\startsetups beesample

  [width=13cm,
   height=9cm]

\setlayer

The first samples, shown in \in {figure} [fig:parasol], will be typeset using:

\typebuffer[a]

The second example, shown in \in {figure} [fig:beekeeper], is done in a similar
way. We redefine the \type {beetext} setup.

\typebuffer[b]

You can zoom in on cells using your viewer. An enlarged example is shown in \in
{figure} [fig:big].

\startbuffer
\definecolor[BeeColor][BeeColorC]%

     {\startsetups[beetext]\getbuffer[parasol]\stopsetups

      \def\BeeLines{20}\setups[beeloner]}}

\stopcombination

\typebuffer

Choosing the best alternative is a matter of taste. If you ever get a change to
see the \CD\ (a good buy anyway) you will note the difference. It is possible to
improve the spacing at the top and bottom but we leave this as an exercise.

The downside of this exercise was that in the process my laptop suddenly made
some funny noises and made me end up with a cracked \CD. So in the end the
message may be not to bother too much about badly typeset paragraphs in \CD\
booklets.
