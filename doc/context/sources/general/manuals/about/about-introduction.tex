\startchapter[title={Introduction}]

During the development of \LUATEX\ we wrapped up the state of affairs in articles
and reports. Upto version 0.50 we tagged them as \quote {\MKIV} (the transition
from \MKII), while for the next 0.25 versions we bundled them in \quote {hybrid}
(the rewrite of \CONTEXT). The next series goes under the name \type {about} as
one might wonder what all this \LUATEX\ and \CONTEXT\ is about. After all we've
now reached a state where we can think about future applications instead of
improving older features as that process is ongoing.

As we're a bit beyond experimenting now, the focus will be on practical usage and
of course we target on applications that the \LUA\ and \TEX\ combination makes
possible, either new or in a renewed form. Some of the chapters will eventually
become part of manuals.

As with the two preceding collections of \LUATEX\ development stories, \quote
{mk} and \quote {hybrid}, this one, called \quote {about}, covers a stretch of
development, mostly between versions 0.50 and 0.75. The forth stretch, upto 1.00
is covered in \quote {still}.
