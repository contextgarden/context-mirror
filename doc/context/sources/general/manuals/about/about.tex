% comment   : Because this manual is distributed with TeX distributions it comes with a rather
%             liberal license. We try to adapt these documents to upgrades in the (sub)systems
%             that they describe. Using parts of the content otherwise can therefore conflict
%             with existing functionality and we cannot be held responsible for that. Many of
%             the manuals contain characteristic graphics and personal notes or examples that
%             make no sense when used out-of-context.
%
% comment   : Some chapters have been published in TugBoat, the NTG Maps, the ConTeXt Group
%             journal or otherwise. Thanks to the editors for corrections.
