\index {implementors}
\index {scanners}

Here we discuss methods to define macros that directly interface with the \LUA\
side. It involves all kind of scanners. There are actually more than we discuss
here but some are meant for low level usage. What is describe here has been used
for ages and works quite well.

{\em We don't discuss some of the more obscure options here. Some are there just
because we need them as part of bootstrapping or initializing code and are of no
real use to users.}

\stopsection

\startsection[title={A teaser first}]

Most of this chapter is examples and you learn \TEX\ (and \LUA) best by just
playing around. The nice thing about \TEX\ is that it's all about visual output,
so that's why in the next examples we just typeset some of what we just scanned.
Of course in practice the \type {actions} will be more complex.

\unexpanded\def\showmeaning#1%
  {\begingroup
   \dontleavehmode
   \ttbf\string #1\space
   \tttf\meaning#1%
   \endgroup}

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroA",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "string",
        actions   = function(s)
            context("(%s)",s)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroA{123}
\MyMacroA{abc}
\edef\temp{\MyMacroA{abc}}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

By default a macro gets defined in the \type {\clf_} namespace but the \type
{public} option makes it visible. This default indicates that it is actually a
low level mechanism in origin. More often than not these interfaces are used like
this:

\starttyping
\def\MyMacro#1{... \clf_MyMacroA{#1} ...}
\stoptyping

When we look at the meaning of \type {\MyMacroA} we get:

\blank \showmeaning\MyMacroA \blank

And when we apply this macro as:

\typebuffer[usage]

We get

\blank \getbuffer[usage] \blank

The meaning of \type {\temp} is:

\blank \showmeaning\temp \blank

We can also define the macro to be protected (\type {\unexpanded}) in \CONTEXT\
speak). We can overload existing scanners but unless we specify the \type
{overload} option, we get a warning on the console.

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroA",
        public    = true,
--      overload  = true,
        protected = true,
        arguments = "string",
        actions   = function(s)
            context("[%s]",s)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

This time we get:

\getbuffer[usage]

The meaning of \type {\temp} is:

\blank \showmeaning\temp \blank

\stopsection

\startsection[title={Basic data types}]

\index {implementors+arguments}

It is actually possible to write very advanced scanners but unless you're in for
obscurity the limited subset discussed here is normally enough. The \CONTEXT\
user interface is rather predictable, unless you want to show off with weird
additional interfaces, for instance by using delimiters other than curly braces
and brackets, or by using separators other than commas.

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroB",
        public    = true,
        arguments = { "string", "integer", "boolean", "dimen" },
        actions   = function(s,i,b,d)
            context("<%s> <%i> <%l> <%p>",s,i,b,d)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

This time we grab four arguments, each of a different type:

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroB{foo} 123 true 45.67pt

\def\temp       {oof}
\scratchcounter 321
\scratchdimen   76.54pt

\MyMacroB\temp \scratchcounter false \scratchdimen
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[usage]

The above usage gives:

\getbuffer[usage]

As you can see, registers can be used as well, and the \type {\temp} macro is
also accepted as argument. The integer and dimen arguments scan standard \TEX\
values. If you want a \LUA\ number you can specify that as well. As our first
example showed, when there is one argument you don't need an array to specify
it.

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroC",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "number",
        actions   = function(f)
            context("<%.2f>",f)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroC 1.23
\MyMacroC 1.23E4
\MyMacroC -1.23E4
\MyMacroC 0x1234
\stopbuffer

As you can see, hexadecimal numbers are also accepted:

\typebuffer[usage]

The above usage gives:

\getbuffer[usage]

\stopsection

\startsection[title={Tables}]

\index {implementors+tables}

A list can be grabbed too. The individual items are separated by spaces and
items can be bound by braces.

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroD",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "list",
        actions   = function(t)
            context("< % + t >",t)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroD { 1 2 3 4 {5 6} }
\stopbuffer

The macro call:

\typebuffer[usage]

results in:

\getbuffer[usage]

Often in \LUA\ scripts tables are uses all over the place. Picking up a table is
also supported by the implementer.

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroE",
        public    = true,
        arguments = {
            {
                { "bar", "integer" },
                { "foo", "dimen" },
            }
        },
        actions   = function(t)
            context("<foo : %p> <bar : %i>",t.foo,t.bar)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroE {
    foo 12pt
    bar 34
}
\stopbuffer

Watch out, we don't use equal signs and commas here:

\typebuffer[usage]

We get:

\getbuffer[usage]

All the above can be combined:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroF",
        public    = true,
        arguments = {
            "string",
            {
                { "bar", "integer" },
                { "foo", "dimen" },
            },
            {
                { "one", "string" },
                { "two", "string" },
            },
        },
        actions   = function(s,t1,t2)
            context("<%s> <%p> <%i> <%s> <%s>",s,t1.foo,t1.bar,t2.one,t2.two)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroF
    {oeps}
    { foo 12pt bar 34 }
    { one {x} two {y} }
\stopbuffer

The following call:

\typebuffer[usage]

Results in one string and two table arguments.

\getbuffer[usage]

You can nest tables, as in:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroG",
        public    = true,
        arguments = {
            "string",
            "string",
            {
                { "data", "string" },
                { "tab", "string" },
                { "method", "string" },
                { "foo", {
                    { "method", "integer" },
                    { "compact", "number" },
                    { "nature" },
                    { "*" }, -- any key
                } },
                { "compact", "string", "tonumber" },
                { "nature", "boolean" },
                { "escape" },
            },
            "boolean",
        },
        actions   = function(s1, s2, t, b)
            context("<%s> <%s>",s1,s2)
            context("<%s> <%s> <%s>",t.data,t.tab,t.compact)
            context("<%i> <%s> <%s>",t.foo.method,t.foo.nature,t.foo.whatever)
            context("<%l>",b)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroG
    {s1}
    {s2}
    {
        data    {d}
        tab     {t}
        compact {12.34}
        foo     { method 1 nature {n} whatever {w} }
    }
    true
\relax
\stopbuffer

Although the \type {\relax} is not really needed in the next calls, I often use
it to indicate that we're done:

\typebuffer[usage]

This typesets:

\getbuffer[usage]

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Expansion]

\index {implementors+expansion}

When working with scanners it is important to realize that we have to do with an
expansion engine. When \TEX\ picks up a token, it can be done as-is, that is the
raw token, but it can also expand that token first (which can be recursive) and
then pick up the first token that results from that. Sometimes you want that
expansion, for instance when you pick up keywords, sometimes you don't.

Expansion effects are most noticeable when we pickup a \quote {string} kind of
value. In the implementor we have two methods for that: \type {string} and \type
{argument}. The argument method has an expandable form (the default) and one
that doesn't expand. Take this:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroH",
        public    = true,
        arguments = {
            "string",
            "argument",
            "argumentasis",
        },
        actions   = function(a,b,c)
            context.type(a or "-") context.quad()
            context.type(b or "-") context.quad()
            context.type(c or "-") context.crlf()
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

Now take this input:

\startbuffer[usage]
\def\a{A} \def\b{B} \def\c{C}
\MyMacroH{a}{b}{c}
\MyMacroH{a\a}{b\b}{c\c}
\MyMacroH\a\b\c\relax
\MyMacroH\a xx\relax
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[usage]

We we use the string method we need a \type {\relax} (or some spacer) to end
scanning of the string when we don't use curly braces. The last line is
actually kind of tricky because the macro expects two arguments after
scanning the first string.

\blank {\getbuffer[usage]} \blank

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroI",
        public    = true,
        arguments = {
            "argument",
            "argumentasis",
        },
        actions   = function(a,b,c)
            context.type(a or "-") context.quad()
            context.type(b or "-") context.quad()
            context.type(c or "-") context.crlf()
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

Here is a variant:

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\def\a{A} \def\b{B}
\MyMacroI{a}{b}
\MyMacroI{a\a}{b\b}
\MyMacroI\a\b\relax
\stopbuffer

With:

\typebuffer[usage]

we get:

\blank {\getbuffer[usage]} \blank

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Boxes]

\index {implementors+boxes}

You can pick up a box too. The value returned is a list node:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroJ",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "box",
        actions   = function(b)
            context(b)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

The usual box specifiers are supported:

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroJ \hbox        {\strut Test 1}
\MyMacroJ \hbox to 4cm {\strut Test 2}
\stopbuffer

So, with:

\typebuffer[usage]

we get:

\blank {\forgetall\dontcomplain\getbuffer[usage]} \blank

There are three variants that don't need the box operator \type {hbox}, \type
{vbox} and \type {vtop}:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroL",
        public    = true,
        arguments = {
            "hbox",
            "vbox",
        },
        actions   = function(h,v)
            context(h)
            context(v)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

Again, the usual box specifiers are supported:

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroL            {\strut Test 1h} to 10mm {\vfill Test 1v\vfill}
\MyMacroL spread 1cm {\strut Test 2h} to 15mm {\vfill Test 2v\vfill}
\stopbuffer

This:

\typebuffer[usage]

gives:

\blank {\forgetall\dontcomplain\showboxes \getbuffer[usage]} \blank

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Like \CONTEXT]

\index {implementors+hashes}
\index {implementors+arrays}

The previously discussed scanners don't use equal signs and commas as separators,
but you can enforce that regime in the following way:


\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroN",
        public    = true,
        arguments = {
            "hash",
            "array",
        },
        actions   = function(h, a)
            context.totable(h)
            context.quad()
            context.totable(a)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroN
    [ a = 1,  b = 2 ]
    [ 3, 4, 5, {6 7} ]
\stopbuffer

This:

\typebuffer[usage]

gives:

\blank {\getbuffer[usage]} \blank

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Verbatim]

\index {implementors+verbatim}

There are a couple of rarely used scanners (there are more of course but these
are pretty low level and not really used directly using implementors).

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroO",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "verbatim",
        actions   = function(v)
            context.type(v)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroO{this is \something verbatim}
\stopbuffer

There is no expansion applied in:

\typebuffer[usage]

so we get what we input:

\blank {\getbuffer[usage]} \blank

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Macros]

\index {implementors+macros}

We can pick up a control sequence without bothering what it actually
represents:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroP",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "csname",
        actions   = function(c)
            context("{\\ttbf name:} {\\tttf %s}",c)
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroP\framed
\stopbuffer

The next control sequence is picked up and its name without the leading
escape character is returned:

\typebuffer[usage]

So here we get:

\blank {\getbuffer[usage]} \blank

\stopsection

\startsection[title={Token lists}]

\index {implementors+token lists}

If you have no clue what tokens are in the perspective of \TEX, you can skip this
section. We can grab a token list in two ways. The most \LUA ish way is to grab
it as a table:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroQ",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "toks",
        actions   = function(t)
            context("%S : ",t)
            context.sprint(t)
            context.crlf()
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroQ{this is a {\bf token} list}
\MyMacroQ{this is a \inframed{token} list}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[usage]

The above sample code gives us:

\blank {\getbuffer[usage]} \blank

An alternative is to keep the list a user data object:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroR",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "tokenlist",
        actions   = function(t)
            context("%S : ",t)
            context.sprint(t)
            context.crlf()
        end,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroR{this is a {\bf token} list}
\MyMacroR{this is a \inframed{token} list}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[usage]

Now we get:

\blank {\getbuffer[usage]} \blank

\stopsection

\startsection[title={Actions}]

\index {implementors+actions}

The plural \type {actions} suggests that there can be more than one and indeed
that is the case. The next example shows a sequence of actions that are applied.
The first one gets the arguments passes.

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroS",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "string",
        actions   = { characters.upper, context },
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroS{uppercase}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[usage]

Gives: \inlinebuffer[usage]

You can pass default arguments too. That way you can have multiple macros using
the same action. Here's how to do that:

\startbuffer[definition]
\startluacode
    local function MyMacro(a,b,sign)
        if sign then
            context("$%i + %i = %i$",a,b,a+b)
        else
            context("$%i - %i = %i$",a,b,a-b)
        end
    end

    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroPlus",
        public    = true,
        arguments = { "integer", "integer", true },
        actions   = MyMacro,
    }

    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacroMinus",
        public    = true,
        arguments = { "integer", "integer", false },
        actions   = MyMacro,
    }
\stopluacode
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[definition] \getbuffer[definition]

So,

\startbuffer[usage]
\MyMacroPlus  654 321 \crlf
\MyMacroMinus 654 321 \crlf
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[usage]

Gives:

\getbuffer[usage]

If you need to pass a string, you pass it as \type {"'preset'"}, so single quotes
inside the double ones. Otherwise strings are interpreted as scanner types.

\stopsection

\startsection[title={Embedded \LUA\ code}]

When you mix \TEX\ and \LUA, you can put the \LUA\ code in a \TEX\ file, for
instance a style. In the previous sections we used this approach:

\starttyping
\startluacode
    -- lua code
\stopluacode
\stoptyping

This method is both reliable and efficient but you need to keep into mind that
macros get expanded. In the next code, the second line will give an error when
you have not defined \type {\foo} as expandable macro. When it is unexpandable it
will get passed as it is and \LUA\ will see a \type {\f} as an escaped character.
So, when you want a macro be passes as macro, you need to do it as in the third
line. The fact that there is a comment trigger (\type {--}) doesn't help here.

\starttyping
\startluacode
    context("foo")
 -- context("\foo")
    context("\\bar")
\stopluacode
\stoptyping

When you use \type {\ctxlua} the same is true but there you also need to keep an
eye on special characters. For instance a percent sign is then interpreted in the
\TEX\ way and because all becomes one line, a \type {--} somewhere in the middle
will make the rest of the line comment:

\starttyping
\ctxlua {
    context("foo")
 %  context("\foo")
 -- context("\\bar")
}
\stoptyping

Here, the second line goes away (\TEX\ comment) and the third line obscures all
that follows. You can use \type {\letterpercent} to smuggle a percent sign in a
\type {\ctxlua} call. Special characters like a hash symbol also need to be
passed by name. Normally curly braces are no problem because \LUA\ also likes
them properly nested.

When things become too messy and complex you can always put the code in an
external file and load that one (e.g. with \type {require}.

In the examples in this chapter we put the function in the table, but for long
ones you might want to do this:

\starttyping
\startluacode
    local function MyMacro(s)
        -- lots of code
    end

    interfaces.implement {
        name      = "MyMacro",
        public    = true,
        arguments = "string",
        actions   = MyMacro,
    }
\stopluacode
\stoptyping

It is a common mistake not to define variables and functions as local. If you
define them global for sure there will become a time when this bites you.
