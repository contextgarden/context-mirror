% comment   : Because this manual is distributed with TeX distributions it comes with a rather
%             liberal license. We try to adapt these documents to upgrades in the (sub)systems
%             that they describe. Using parts of the content otherwise can therefore conflict
%             with existing functionality and we cannot be held responsible for that. Many of
%             the manuals contain characteristic graphics and personal notes or examples that
%             make no sense when used out-of-context.

% comment   : Some chapters might have been published in TugBoat, the NTG Maps, the ConTeXt
%             Group journal or otherwise. Thanks to the editors for corrections. Also thanks
%             to users for testing, feedback and corrections.

\startbuffer[abstract]

    This book is about colors and how to use them in \CONTEXT\ \MKIV, including
    \METAFUN. Although the basics are not that complex, a bit of insight in how
    they are implemented and what can be done might help in creating more
    interesting looking documents.
