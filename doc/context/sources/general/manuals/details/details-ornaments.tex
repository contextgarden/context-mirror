\startchapter[title={Ornaments everywhere}]

The background mechanisms present in \CONTEXT\ have evolved over time and with
computers becoming faster, you can expect new functionality to show up and
existing functionality to start using this technology. A simple background
consist of a colored area. Many commands accept settings like:

\starttyping
...[background=color,backgroundcolor=red,backgroundoffset=3pt]
\stoptyping

Instead of such an area you can define one or more so called
overlays:

\starttyping
\defineoverlay[one][...]
\defineoverlay[two][...]

...[background={one,two}]
\stoptyping

The name overlay comes from the fact that you stack them on top of each other. A
special overlay is \type {foreground}, and deep down in \CONTEXT\ there are more
predefined overlays.

In the \METAFUN\ manual you will find example of usage, so here we stick to a
simple code snippet for testing this functionality:

\startbuffer
\defineoverlay[one][\green A]
\defineoverlay[two][\red   B]

\framed[background=one]       {1}
\framed[background={one,two}] {1---2}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

The rather ugly result is:

\startlinecorrection
\hbox{\getbuffer}
\stoplinecorrection

You can construct overlays by using \TEX\ boxing primitives or commands like
\type {\framed}. Alternatively you can use another mechanism: layers. Layers
collect content and flush that when asked, for instance when an overlay is
constructed. Layers can be independent of a page, or bound to a specific page
number, left or right hand pages. Here we look at independent layers.

All these mechanisms are fine tuned for cooperating with the output routine (the
part of \TEX\ that deals with composing pages) and are well interact quite well
with \METAPOST\ graphics. Details of usage and tricks are revealed in this manual
as well as in styles that come with \CONTEXT. In this chapter we will apply
layers to graphics. For this we need a few setups, like:

\starttyping
\setupbackgrounds
  [page]
  [background=pagegraphics]
\stoptyping

Here we have set up the page background to use an overlay called \type
{pagegraphics}. However, instead of an overlay, we will use a layer. This layer
will collect content that goes into the page background. Whenever a layer is
defined, an overlay is automatically defined as well.

\startbuffer
\definelayer
  [pagegraphics]
  [x=-2mm,
   y=-2mm,
   width=\paperwidth,
   height=\paperheight]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

When you fill a layer with content, you can influence the placement with the
\type {x} and \type {y} parameters as well as \type {hoffset} and \type
{voffset}, whichever you prefer. The reference point and alignment are set with
\type {corner} and \type {location}.

Live can be made easier by using presets, especially for our intended usage. The
following presets are predefined.

\startbuffer
\definelayerpreset
  [lefttop]     [corner={left,top},    location={right,bottom}]
\definelayerpreset
  [righttop]    [corner={right,top},   location={left,bottom}]
\definelayerpreset
  [leftbottom]  [corner={left,bottom}, location={right,top}]
\definelayerpreset
  [rightbottom] [corner={right,bottom},location={left,top}]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

Because for this layer we have also preset the \type {x} and \type {y}, those
corners are laying a few millimeters outside the page area. We have preset the
size as well, otherwise all corners would end up in the top left corner.

We will now fill this layer. Because the layer is hooked into the page, it will
be flushed when the page is constructed. After the page is written to the output
file, the layer is emptied, unless its \type {state} is set to \type {repeat}.

\startbuffer
\setlayer [extras] [preset=lefttop]     {\externalfigure[hacker]}
\setlayer [extras] [preset=righttop]    {\externalfigure[hacker]}
\setlayer [extras] [preset=leftbottom]  {\externalfigure[hacker]}
\setlayer [extras] [preset=rightbottom] {\externalfigure[hacker]}
\stopbuffer

\testpage[5] \typebuffer \getbuffer

Once you got the picture of layering, you will start using this mechanism for all
kind of tasks. Instead of putting layers in a background, you can also directly
place them, by using one of the two (equivalent) commands:

\starttyping
\composedlayer{identifier}
\placelayer[identifier]
\stoptyping

Layer are quite convenient for defining title pages, colophons, and special
section heads, especially in combination with \type {\framed}.

On top of the layer mechanism we have build a few more mechanisms, like
ornaments. You can use ornaments to annotate graphics in such a way that the
dimensions stay unchanged.

\startbuffer
\defineornament
  [affiliation]
  [rotation=90,corner={right,bottom},location={right,top},
   hoffset=-.25ex]
  [frame=on,background=color,backgroundcolor=red,offset=0pt]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

The negative offset will overlay the text outside the graphic. The meaning of the
sign of coordinates and offsets depends on the corner. \in {Figure} [fig:affi-1]
shows the result. We have put the reference point in the right bottom corner. The
ornament is anchored at the right top corner of the dot you can picture at the
reference point. The ornament is shifted .25ex outwards.

\starttyping
\placefigure
  {}
  {\affiliation{graphic}{\externalfigure[hacker][width=3cm]}}
\stoptyping

\placefigure
  [here] [fig:affi-1] {Number 1}
  {\affiliation{graphic}{\externalfigure[hacker][width=3cm]}}

There are two ways to handle the placement. Alternative \type {a} will change the
dimensions of the graphic according to the size of the ornament, while
alternative \type {b} acts as a pure overlay. In \in {figure} [fig:affi-2] the
ornament is not taken into account when calculating the dimensions of the
graphic. This is often the preferred placement, because this way the (often
small) ornament will not it will not spoil visual alignment of similar graphics.

\startbuffer
\defineornament
  [affiliation]
  [rotation=90,corner={right,bottom},location={right,top},
   hoffset=-.25ex,alternative=b]
  [frame=on,background=color,backgroundcolor=red,offset=0pt]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

\placefigure
  [here] [fig:affi-2] {Number 2}
  {\affiliation{graphic}{\externalfigure[hacker][width=3cm]}}

A positive offset will place the ornament on top of the graphic (see \in {figure}
[fig:affi-3]).

\startbuffer
\defineornament
  [affiliation]
  [rotation=90,corner={right,bottom},location={left,top},
   hoffset=.25ex,voffset=.25ex,alternative=a]
  [background=color,style=\ss\tfxx,backgroundcolor=white,offset=0pt]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

\placefigure
  [here] [fig:affi-3] {Number 3}
  {\affiliation{graphic}{\externalfigure[hacker][width=3cm]}}

You need to play a bit with this mechanism in order to get a feeling for what the
parameters do.

\startbuffer
\defineornament
  [affiliation]
  [rotation=90,corner={right,bottom},location={left,top},
   hoffset=.25ex,voffset=.25ex,alternative=b]
  [background=color,style=\ss\tfxx,backgroundcolor=white,offset=0pt]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

\placefigure
  [here] [fig:affi-4] {Number 4}
  {\affiliation{graphic}{\externalfigure[hacker][width=3cm]}}

Because the text is normally typeset quite small, you'd better use a font that
can be scaled down a lot.

\startbuffer
\definefont[AffiliationFont][Sans sa .25]

\defineornament
  [SomeAffiliation]
  [rotation=90,corner={right,bottom},location={right,top},
   hoffset=-.125ex,alternative=b]
  [style=AffiliationFont,offset=0pt]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

This affiliation is used as:

\startbuffer
\placefigure
  {Affiliations normally are typeset pretty small.}

Ornaments are implemented in terms of layers and collectors. A few examples
demonstrate how these can be used.

\startbuffer

There are several methods to construct title pages, headers, and other
compositions. Of course there are the low level box constructors like \type
{\hbox}, \type {\vbox} and positioning primitives like \type {\hskip}, \type
{\hfill} and alike.

Another option is to fall back on the low level box macros in the \CONTEXT\
support file \type {supp-box} or the higher level \type {\framed} macro. You can
use \type {\framed} nested and by cleverly using the offsets and dimensions you
can do a lot.

Layers are another means. You can or instance construct a title page in the
following way:

\starttyping
\definelayer
  [titlepage]
  [width=\textwidth,
   height=\textheight]

\setlayer
  [titlepage]
  [preset=righttop,location={left,bottom},y=1cm,x=1cm]
  {\definedfont[Regular at 60pt]Welcome}

\setlayer
  [titlepage]
  [preset=rightbottom,location={right,top},y=2cm,x=2cm]
  {\definedfont[Regular at 30pt]By Me}
\stoptyping

This just fills the layer. Placement is done with:

\starttyping
\startstandardmakeup
  \flushlayer[titlepage]
\stopstandardmakeup
\stoptyping

or alternatively:

\starttyping
\setupbackgrounds[text][background=titlepage]
\startstandardmakeup \stopstandardmakeup
\setupbackgrounds[text][background=]
\stoptyping

Another way to collect content is to use a collector. A collector starts out
empty with:

\startbuffer
\definecollector[test][state=repeat]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

We can now stepwise fill this collector. For educational purposes we've turn of
tracing so that you can see what the anchor points.

\startbuffer
\setcollector[test]
  [location={right,bottom}]
  {\externalfigure[detcow][frame=on,width=3cm]}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer {\traceboxplacementtrue \getbuffer}

\startlinecorrection[blank] \flushcollector[test] \stoplinecorrection

\startbuffer
\setcollector[test]
  [corner={right,bottom},location={left,top}]
  {\framed[background=color,backgroundcolor=tyellow]{this is a cow}}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer {\traceboxplacementtrue \getbuffer}

\startlinecorrection[blank] \flushcollector[test] \stoplinecorrection

\startbuffer
\setcollector[test]
  [corner={right,bottom},location={right,bottom}]
  {\framed[background=color,backgroundcolor=tblue]{that's for sure}}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer {\traceboxplacementtrue \getbuffer}

\startlinecorrection[blank] \flushcollector[test] \stoplinecorrection

\startbuffer
\setcollector[test]
  [corner={left,top},location={left,top}]
  {\framed[background=color,backgroundcolor=tgreen]{a dutch cow}}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer {\traceboxplacementtrue \getbuffer}

\startlinecorrection[blank] \flushcollector[test] \stoplinecorrection

\startbuffer
\setcollector[test]
  [corner=middle,
   location=middle]
  {\framed[background=color,backgroundcolor=tred]{nearly done}}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer {\traceboxplacementtrue \getbuffer}

\startlinecorrection[blank] \flushcollector[test] \stoplinecorrection

In addition to the parameters shown here, you can also provide additional ones:
\type {x}, \type {y}, \type {offset}, \type {hoffset} and \type {voffset} for
positioning and \type {rotation} for (as expected) rotating the content in steps
of 90 degrees. As with layers, the coordinates and offsets can be used
intermixed.

\startbuffer
\setcollector[test]
  [hoffset=4cm,
   voffset=-1cm,
   corner=middle,
   location=middle]
  {\framed{now}}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer {\traceboxplacementtrue \getbuffer}

\startlinecorrection[blank] \flushcollector[test] \stoplinecorrection

We can show the intermediate results because we have set the state of this
collector to repeat. In this case you need to erase the content manually, using:

\startbuffer
\resetcollector[test]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer \getbuffer

The chapter titles of this document are (as usual in a \CONTEXT\ document)
typeset by the \type {\chapter} macro. When thinking about implementing a non
standard head, those familiar with \CONTEXT's head macros will probably first
think of using one of the hooks, like:

\starttyping
\setuphead[chapter][command=\MyChapterHead]
\stoptyping

Here we have followed a different approach. First we set up the chapter head. The
\type {empty} directive instructs \CONTEXT\ not to place the head itself, but
still to include the associated data in the text stream. This means that we will
not see a chapter title, but that there will be an entry in the table of
contents, that references will be set up, that so called marks will be available,
etc.

\starttyping
\setuphead
  [chapter]
  [placehead=empty,
   header=chapter,
   style=\BigText,
   numberstyle=\BigNumber]
\stoptyping

The \type {header} parameters instructs the head handler to mark this page as
special with regards to header texts. This text is set up as follows:

\starttyping
\definetext
  [chapter]
  [header]
  [\setups{chapter}]
  []
\stoptyping

The setups are just series of typesetting instructions. For the sake of
readability, we have split them up.

\starttyping
\startsetups chapter
  \setups[chapter:title]
  \setups[chapter:number]
  \setups[chapter:finish]
\stopsetups
\stoptyping

The setups will use a dedicated layer for the chapter title:

\starttyping
\definelayer
  [chapter]
  [width=\dimexpr\makeupwidth+\cutspace\relax,
   height=\headerheight]
\stoptyping

The following code uses a macro \type {\setlayerframed}. This is a combination
between \type {\setlayer} and \type {\framed}. We use two placement macros to
typeset the title and number. When doing so, we need to take care of both
numbered chapters and unnumbered titles.

\starttyping
\startsetups chapter:title

  \setlayerframed
    [chapter]
    [x=\dimexpr\makeupwidth+\cutspace\relax,location={left,bottom}]
    [height=\headerheight,
     foregroundcolor=white,
     background=color,
     backgroundcolor=blue,
     frame=off,
     offset=none,
     align={right,lohi}]
    {\hbox spread .5\cutspace
       {\hss
        \doiftextelse{\placeheadtext[chapter]}%
          {\placeheadtext[chapter]}%
          {\placeheadtext[title]}%
        \hss}\space
     \vskip.5cm}

\stopsetups
\stoptyping

Definitions like these may look complicated but in practice you will construct
them piece|-|wise.

\starttyping
\startsetups chapter:number

  \setlayerframed
    [chapter]
    [x=\dimexpr\makeupwidth+\cutspace\relax,
     y=\vsize,
     location={left,bottom}]
    [width=\dimexpr\cutspace-\rightmargindistance\relax,
     height=\dimexpr\cutspace-\rightmargindistance\relax,
     foregroundcolor=white,
     background=color,
     backgroundcolor=red,
     frame=off,
     offset=none,
     align={middle,lohi}]
    {\hbox to \hsize
       {\hskip.5cm\hss
        \doifmode{*bodypart}{\placeheadnumber[chapter]}%
        \hss}}

\stopsetups
\stoptyping

The finishing touch is just a dummy frame with the chapter background. We could
have used the header text background instead.

\starttyping
\startsetups chapter:finish

  \framed
    [width=\makeupwidth,
     height=\headerheight,
     background=chapter,
     frame=off]
    {}

\stopsetups
\stoptyping

As the title of this manual suggests: it's in the details. Most of our time is
spent in optimizing spacing issues. If you're designing the layout yourself, for
a large part you can fall back on the consistent spacing provided by \TEX, i.e.\
think in terms of \type {em}'s, \type {ex}'s and fractions or multiples of \type
{\bodyfontsize}, as well as base you're dimensions on those provided by the
layout. When dealing with translating a \DTP\ layout into something \TEX,
definitions like the above will often look more messy.
