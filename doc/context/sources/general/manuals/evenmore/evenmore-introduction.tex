\startchapter[title={Introduction}]

After five collections of \quote {articles} about the development of \LUATEX,
\CONTEXT\ \MKIV, \LUAMETATEX\ and \CONTEXT\ \LMTX, there is even more to tell so
here is number six. Wrapping up not only serves to inform the users but for me it is
also a way to get things right: if you cannot write it down it's no good. It forces
me to (re)consider interfaces and also test new code but of course it comes with
no guarantees.

When writing this introduction I just finished the first chapter, about some new
font stuff, as follow up on the (again) nice \CONTEXT\ meeting in 2019. It's
always inspiring to meet and talk with my \TEX\ friends and see what they're
doing. It keeps me going.

Some chapters end up in user group journals first so they will be added once they
have been published and are available. The advantage is that these are then
copy|-|edited. Many texts, also in previous development updates, got better
because Karl Berry checked them thoroughly for TUGboat, for which I'm grateful.

Hopefully, this document serves a purpose.
