\startchapter[title={Scaled fonts}]

Although \CONTEXT\ is quite efficient with fonts there is always room for
improvement. However, after years of fine tuning the font mechanisms there was
not that much room left. On the average, given that \TEX\ is mostly about fonts,
what we have is quite okay, but for some scripts, like \CJK\ the demands on
resources can be rather high. This made me think of a different approach to
scaling. Nowadays fonts seldom come in design sizes. Also, in \CONTEXT\ \MKIV\
and therefore \LMTX\ we always had so called dynamic features: apply additional
features locally, although that comes with a small penalty in performance, it
saves additional font instances. It is a good approach for the occasional small
stretch of glyphs, like small capped logos and such.

Using a font at a larger size means that we need to provide \TEX\ with the right
dimensions: it needs them for instance for for braking paragraph into lines or
wrapping text in boxes. The amount of information that \TEX\ needs is small: only
dimensions. Of course there are ligatures and kerns but in so called base mode we
seldom have many. The data needed for node mode (used for more complex \OPENTYPE\
fonts) can be shared and lives at the \LUA\ end. But even then the character
table is copied and scaled. Actually, we seldom need that information but it is
good to have it and in the case of virtual fonts it is needed. But, when a font
is used at a different size, and al the features are the same, we can think of
a different approach.

That approach is tagged as \quote {dynamic font scaling}, which means that we
don't need to define a new font instance when the same feature set is used. Or
course in addition to this features one can still use the dynamic features. This
means that for instance chapter titling can use the bodyfont instance and just
apply additional scaling. Although for a normal run the number of loaded fonts is
normally small, and the number of instances also isn't that impressive it can
happen in a large document that you end up with a few dozen. That number can now
be reduced to half a dozen.

Of course there can be side effects, which is why it's currently tagged as
experimental. There is also a small performance hit because we now need to track
it but that is gained back because we load less fonts and have less glyph runs.

So how does it work? Here is an example:

\startbuffer
\definescaledfont[MyLargerFontA][scale=2000,style=bold]

test {\MyLargerFontA test} test
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This gives:

\getbuffer

You can also say:

\startbuffer
\definescaledfont[MyLargerFontB][xscale=1200,yscale=2000,style=bold]

test {\MyLargerFontB test} test
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Which scaled the over two axis:

\getbuffer

The low level implementation uses the two variables \type {\glyphxscale} and
\type {\glyphyscale} that take a number. As with other \TEX\ scaling related
variables, a value of 1000 represents 1.0 so we have three digits precision.

Because we just scale, the next also works:

\startbuffer
test {\MyLargerFontB test {\em test} test} test
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

The nested emphasis still works:

\getbuffer

For now we only have a simple user interface but it might eventually be more
integrated. For instance, we can consider defining \type {\tfa} and friends this
way.

In order to make it useful, math is also supported:

\startbuffer
\definescaledfont[MyLargerFontC][xscale=1200,yscale=2000]

test {\MyLargerFontC test $\sqrt{x}$ test} test
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

gives:

\getbuffer

You can actually use negative values, as is demonstrated in the following
code:

\startbuffer
\bTABLE[align=middle]
  \bTR
    \bTD a{\glyphxscale  1000 \glyphyscale  1000 bc}d \eTD
    \bTD a{\glyphxscale  1000 \glyphyscale -1000 bc}d \eTD
    \bTD a{\glyphxscale -1000 \glyphyscale -1000 bc}d \eTD
    \bTD a{\glyphxscale -1000 \glyphyscale  1000 bc}d \eTD
  \eTR
  \bTR
    \bTD \tttf +1000 +1000 \eTD
    \bTD \tttf +1000 -1000 \eTD
    \bTD \tttf -1000 -1000 \eTD
    \bTD \tttf -1000 +1000 \eTD
  \eTR
\eTABLE
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

gives:

\startlinecorrection
\getbuffer
\stoplinecorrection

Because loading and switching fonts in \CONTEXT\ is rather efficient, the gain in
performance is less than you expect. After all, not all time is spent on fonts. Of
course for huge \CJK\ fonts it does make a difference. But, when we do a massive switch
to a different body font, we can save a little more. Think of definitions like:

\starttyping
\definescaledfontbody[BigBodyFont]     [1.200]
\definescaledfontbody[VeryBigBodyFont] [1.440]
\definescaledfont    [MyLargerFont]    [xscale=1.200,yscale=2.000]
\stoptyping

And then:

\starttyping
\setuphead[title][style=\MyLargerFont\bf]
\stoptyping

The savings in runtime can be quite noticeable now, for instance this:

\starttyping
\dorecurse {100} {
    \starttitle[title={Test #1]
        \samplefile{ward}\par
        \start \bf
            \samplefile{ward}\par
        \stop
        \start \BigBodyFont \bf
            \samplefile{ward}\par
        \stop
    \stoptitle
}
\stoptyping

Speeds up a bit for Pagella and even more when we use Cambria. Keep in mind that
that a body font switch also involves setting up some math. Anyway, as a proof of
concept it worked out well.

Glyphs can have offsets and these are used for implementing \OPENTYPE\ features. However,
they are also available at the \TEX\ end. Take this

\startbuffer
\ruledhbox{
    \ruledhbox{\glyph yoffset 1ex options 0 123}
    \ruledhbox{\glyph xoffset .5em yoffset 1ex options "C0 123}
    \ruledhbox{oeps{\glyphyoffset 1ex \glyphxscale 800 \glyphyscale\glyphxscale oeps}oeps}
}
\stopbuffer

This example demonstrates that the \type {\glyph} primitive takes keywords: \type
{xoffset}, \type {yoffset}, \type {xscale}, \type {yscale}, \type {options},
\type {font} and \type {id} where the last two take a font identifier or font id
(an positive number).

\startbuffer
\samplefile{jojomayer}
{\glyphyoffset .8ex
 \glyphxscale 700 \glyphyscale\glyphxscale
 \samplefile{jojomayer}}
{\glyphyscale\numexpr3*\glyphxscale/2\relax
 \samplefile{jojomayer}}
{\glyphyoffset -.2ex
 \glyphxscale 500 \glyphyscale\glyphxscale
 \samplefile{jojomayer}}
\samplefile{jojomayer}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

To quote Jojo Mayer:

\startnarrower
\darkred \getbuffer
\stopnarrower

Keep in mind that this can interfere badly with font feature processing which also
used offsets. It might work out okay, or not.

The scales, as mentioned, works with pseudo scales but that is sometimes a bit
cumbersome. This is why a special \type {\numericscale} primitive has been
introduced.

\startbuffer
1200 : \the\numericscale1200
1.20 : \the\numericscale1.200
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Both these lines produce the same integer:

\startlines\tttf
\getbuffer
\stoplines

When there is a fraction, the value is multiplied by 1000.

So how should this be further integrated? If we drop design sizes at the file
definition level the whole font mechanism could be simplified a lot, but we cannot
do that. Another approach is to let users use the previously mentioned more low
level commands. A but of help can be provided with a command like

\starttyping
\enableautoglyphscaling
\stoptyping

which pays of when it is issues before \type {\starttext} and before a body fonts
gets defined because it does some overloading of defining commands. At the brink
of 2021 I'm not sure yet what is best. One reason is that a compatibility layer
is not really compatible because glyph scaling gives slightly different scaled in
practice (which relates to some old time accuracy hackery). This sounds worse
that it is because in practice scaling is done for sections heads and so, which
are less present and don't interfere with the running text.

Let me stress once more: if you need this kind of scaling it pays off. If you
load multiple instances of large (e.g.\ \CJK) fonts, it makes sense too. But, for
instance on a document like the \LUAMETATEX\ manual it only saves 2 instances on
158, and those are the few bold fonts used for titling.

That said, here is another example:

\startbuffer
\def\UnKernedTeX
  {T%
   {\glyph xoffset -.2ex yoffset -.4ex `E}%
   {\glyph xoffset -.4ex options "60 `X}}

We use \UnKernedTeX\ and {\bf \UnKernedTeX} and {\bs \UnKernedTeX}:
the slanted version could use some more left shifting of the E.
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This gives is the \TEX\ logos (but of course we normally use the real ones
instead).

\getbuffer

After doing this with text, I wondered if we can avoid multiple sizes of an
otherwise same math font. Currently text, script and script script styles all use
the same font, but scaled. And, indeed, experiments show that this can be done,
although the math renderer had to be adapted to it. So, for now it's an
experiment. Users have to check if things are okay. Also, we have slightly
different rounding than with normal scaling. Of course the big advantage is that
we have less instances (math can add up more than text as every size has in fact
three instances).
