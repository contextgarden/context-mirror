\startsection [title={Introduction}]

Occasionally users asked me if \CONTEXT\ can produce tagged \PDF\ and the answer
to that has been: I'll implement it when I need it. However, users tell me that
publishers more and more demand tagged \PDF\ files, although one might wonder
what for, except maybe for accessibility. Another reason for not having spent too
much time on it before is that the specification was not that inviting.

At any rate, when I saw Ross Moore\footnote {He is often exploring the boundaries
of \PDF, \UNICODE\ and evolving techniques related to math publishing so you'd
best not miss his presentations when you are around.} presenting tagged math at
TUG 2010, I decided to look up the spec once more and see if I could get into the
mood to implement tagging. Before I started it was already clear that there were
a couple of boundary conditions:

\startitemize[packed]
\startitem Tagging should not put a burden on the user but users
           should be able to tag themselves. \stopitem
\startitem Tagging should not slow down a run too much; this is
           no big deal as one can postpone tagging till the last
           run. \stopitem
\startitem Tagging should in no way interfere with typesetting, so
           no funny nodes should be injected. \stopitem
\startitem Tagging should not make the code
           look worse, neither the document source, nor the low
           level \CONTEXT\ code. \stopitem
\stopitemize

And of course implementing it should not take more than a few days' work,
certainly not in an exceptionally hot summer.

You can \quote {google} for one of Ross's documents (like \type
{DML_002-2009-1_12.pdf}) to see how a document source looks at his end using a
special version of \PDFTEX. However, the version on my machine didn't support the
shown primitives, so I could not see what was happening under the hood.
Unfortunately it is quite hard to find a properly tagged document so we have only
the reference manual as starting point. As the \PDFTEX\ approach didn't look that
pleasing anyway, I just started from scratch.

Tags can help Acrobat Reader when reading out the text aloud. But you cannot
browse the structure in the no|-|cost version of Acrobat and as not all users
have the professional version of Acrobat, the fact that a document has structure
can go unnoticed. Add to that the fact that the overhead in terms of bytes is
quite large as many more objects are generated, and you will understand why this
feature is not enabled by default.

\stopsection

\startsection [title={Implementation}]

So, what does tagging boil down to? We can best look at how tagged information is
shown in Acrobat. \in {Figure} [fig:tagged-list] shows the content tree that has
been added (automatically) to a document while \in {figure} [fig:tagged-order]
shows a different view.

\placefigure
  [page]
  [fig:tagged-list]
  {A tag list in Acrobat.}
  {\externalfigure[tagged-001.png][maxheight=\textheight]}

\placefigure
  [here]
  [fig:tagged-order]
  {Acrobat showing the tag order.}
  {\externalfigure[tagged-004.png][maxwidth=\textwidth]}

In order to get that far, we have to do the following:

\startitemize[packed]
\startitem Carry information with (typeset) text. \stopitem
\startitem Analyse this information when shipping out pages. \stopitem
\startitem Add a structure tree to the page. \stopitem
\startitem Add relevant information to the document. \stopitem
\stopitemize

That first activity is rather independent of the other three and we can use that
information for other purposes as well, like identifying where we are in the
document. We carry the information around using attributes. The last three
activities took a bit of experimenting mostly using the \quotation {Example of
Logical Structure} from the \PDF\ standard 32000-1:2008.

This resulted in a tagging framework that uses explicit tags, meaning the user is
responsible for the tagging:

\starttyping
\setupstructure[state=start,method=none]

\starttext

\startelement[document]

    \startelement[chapter]
        \startelement[p] \input davis \stopelement \par
    \stopelement

    \startelement[chapter]
        \startelement[p] \input zapf \stopelement \par
        \startelement[whatever]
            \startelement[p] \input tufte \stopelement \par
            \startelement[p] \input knuth \stopelement \par
        \stopelement
    \stopelement

    \startelement[chapter]
        oeps
        \startelement[p] \input ward \stopelement \par
    \stopelement

\stopelement

\stoptext
\stoptyping

Since this is not much fun, we also provide an automated
variant. In the previous example we explicitly turned off automated
tagging by setting \type {method} to \type {none}. By default it has
the value \type {auto}.

\starttyping
\setupstructure[state=start] % default is method=auto

\definedescription[whatever]

\starttext

\startfrontmatter
    \startchapter[title=One]
        \startparagraph \input tufte \stopparagraph
        \startitemize
            \startitem first \stopitem
            \startitem second \stopitem
        \stopitemize
        \startparagraph \input ward \stopparagraph
        \startwhatever {Herman Zapf} \input zapf \stopwhatever
    \stopchapter

\stopfrontmatter

\startbodymatter
    ..................
\stoptyping

If you use commands like \type {\chapter} you will not get the desired results.
Of course these can be supported but there is no real reason for it, as in \MKIV\
we advise using the \type {start}|-|\type {stop} variant.

It will be clear that this kind of automated tagging brings with it a couple of
extra commands deep down in \CONTEXT\ and there (of course) we use symbolic names
for tags, so that one can overload the built|-|in mapping.

\starttyping
\setuptaglabeltext[en][document=text]
\stoptyping

As with other features inspired by viewer functionality, the implementation of
tagging is independent of the backend. For instance, we can tag a document and
access the tagging information at the \TEX\ end. The backend driver code maps
tags to relevant \PDF\ constructs. First of all, we just map the tags used at the
\CONTEXT\ end onto themselves. But, as validators expect certain names, we use
the \PDF\ rolemap feature to map them to (less interesting) names. The next list
shows the currently used internal names, with the \PDF\ ones between parentheses.

\blank \startalignment[flushleft,nothyphenated]
\startluacode
local done = false
for k, v in table.sortedpairs(structures.tags.properties) do
    if v.pdf then
        if done then
            context(", %s (%s)",k,v.pdf)
        else
            context("%s (%s)",k,v.pdf)
            done = true
        end
    end
end
context(".")
\stopluacode \par \stopalignment \blank

So, the internal ones show up in the tag trees as shown in the examples but
applications might use the rolemap which normally has less detail.

Because we keep track of where we are, we can also use that information for
making decisions.

\starttyping
\doifinelementelse{structure:section}            {yes} {no}
\doifinelementelse{structure:chapter}            {yes} {no}
\doifinelementelse{division:*-structure:chapter} {yes} {no}
\doifinelementelse{division:*-structure:*}       {yes} {no}
\stoptyping

As shown, you can use \type {*} as a wildcard. The elements are separated by
\type {-}. If you don't know what tags are used, you can always enable the tag
related tracker:

\starttyping
\enabletrackers[structure.tags]
\stoptyping

This tracker reports the identified element chains to the console
and log.

\stopsection

\startsection[title={Special care}]

Of course there are a few complications. First of all the tagging model sort of
contradicts the concept of a nicely typeset document where structure and outcome
are not always related. Most \TEX\ users are aware of the fact that \TEX\ does
not have space characters and does a great job on kerning and hyphenation. The
tagging machinery on the other hand uses a rather dumb model of strings separated
by spaces. \footnote {The search engine on the other hand is rather clever on
recognizing words.} But we can trick \TEX\ into providing the right information
to the backend so that words get nicely separated. The non|-|optimized function
that does this looks as follows:

\starttyping
function injectspaces(head)
    local p
    for n in node.traverse(head) do
        local id = n.id
        if id == node.id("glue") then
            if p and p.id == node.id("glyph") then
                local g = node.copy(p)
                local s = node.copy(n.spec)
                g.char, n.spec = 32, s
                p.next, g.prev = g, p
                g.next, n.prev = n, g
                s.width = s.width - g.width
            end
        elseif id == node.id("hlist") or id == node.id("vlist") then
            injectspaces(n.list,attribute)
        end
        p = n
    end
end
\stoptyping

Here we squeeze in a space (given that it is in the font which it normally is
when you use \CONTEXT) and make a compensation in the glue. Given that your page
sits in box 255, you can do this just before shipping the page out:

\starttyping
injectspaces(tex.box[255].list)
\stoptyping

Then there are the so|-|called suspects: things on the page that are not related
to structure at all. One is supposed to tag these specially so that the
built|-|in reading equipment is not confused. So far we could get around them
simply because they don't get tagged at all and therefore are not seen anyway.
This might well be enough of a precaution.

Of course we need to deal with mathematics. Fortunately the presentation \MATHML\
model is rather close to \TEX\ and so we can map onto that. After all we don't
need to care too much about back|-|mapping here. The currently present code is
rather experimental and might get extended or thrown out in favour of inline
\MATHML. \in {Figure} [fig:tagged-math] demonstrates that a first approach does
not even look that bad. In future versions we might deal with table|-|like math
constructs, like matrices.

\placefigure

  {Experimental math tagging.}
  {\externalfigure[tagged-005.png][maxwidth=\textwidth]}

This is a typical case where more energy has to be spent on driving the voice of
Acrobat but I will do that when we find a good reason.

As mentioned, it will take a while before all relevant constructs in \CONTEXT\
support tagging, but support is already quite complete. Some screen dumps are
included as examples at the end.

\stopsection

\startsection[title={Conclusion}]

Surprisingly, implementing all this didn't take that much work. Of course
detailed automated structure support from the complete \CONTEXT\ kernel will take
some time to get completed, but that will be done on demand and when we run into
missing bits and pieces. It's still not decided to what extent alternate
representations and alternate texts will be supported. Experiments with the
reading|-|aloud machinery are not satisfying yet but maybe it just can't get any
better. It would be nice if we could get some tags being announced without
overloading the content, that is: without using ugly hacks.

And of course, code like this is never really finished if only because \PDF\
evolves. Also, it is yet another nice test case and torture test for \LUATEX\ and
it helps us to find buglets and oversights.

\stopsection

\startsection [title=Some more examples]

In \CONTEXT\ we have user definable verbatim environments. As with other user
definable environments we show the specific instance as comment next to the
structure component. See \in {figure} [fig:tagged-verbatim]. Some examples of
tables are shown in \in {figure} [fig:tagged-tables]. Future versions will have a
bit more structure. Tables of contents (see \in {figure} [fig:tagged-contents])
and registers (see \in {figure} [fig:tagged-register]) are also tagged. (One
might wonder what the use is of this.) In \in {figure} [fig:tagged-floats] we see
some examples of floats. External images as well as \METAPOST\ graphics are
tagged as such. This example also shows an example of a user environment, in this
case:

\starttyping
\definestartstop[notabene][style=\bf]
\stoptyping

In a similar fashion, footnotes (\in {figure} [fig:tagged-footnotes]) end up in
the structure tree, but in the typeset document they move around (normally
forward when there is no room).
