\startchapter[title=Hyperlinks]

A hyperlink is something that you click on and that brings you to nother spot in
the document. The regular links are a side effect of references. The most commonly
used references are:

\starttyping
\in{figure}[fig:foo]
\at{page}[fig:foo]
\about[fig:foo]
\stoptyping

The first argument is what gets prepended to the number and the while can be
clicked on. Here we create a namespace with \type {fig:}. This can be somewhat
confusing with respect to prefixes but normally the resolver does a direct lookup
first.

\showsetup{at}
\showsetup{in}
\showsetup{about}
