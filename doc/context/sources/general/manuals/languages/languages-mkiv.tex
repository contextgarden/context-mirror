% comment   : Because this manual is distributed with TeX distributions it comes with a rather
%             liberal license. We try to adapt these documents to upgrades in the (sub)systems
%             that they describe. Using parts of the content otherwise can therefore conflict
%             with existing functionality and we cannot be held responsible for that. Many of
%             the manuals contain characteristic graphics and personal notes or examples that
%             make no sense when used out-of-context.

% comment   : Some chapters might have been published in TugBoat, the NTG Maps, the ConTeXt
%             Group journal or otherwise. Thanks to the editors for corrections. Also thanks

\startbuffer[abstract]

    This book explains how we support languages (and scripts) in \CONTEXT\ \MKIV\
    and \LUATEX. Some of the mechanisms discussed are generic and not \CONTEXT\
    specific. We discuss the way languages are dealt with in the engine,
    hyphenation, standard features and additional goodies. Tracing and the
    extensibility of code are also discussed.
