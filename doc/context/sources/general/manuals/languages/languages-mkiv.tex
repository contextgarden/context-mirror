\startbuffer[abstract]

    This book explains how we support languages (and scripts) in \CONTEXT\ \MKIV\
    and \LUATEX. Some of the mechanisms discussed are generic and not \CONTEXT\
    specific. We discuss the way languages are dealt with in the engine,
    hyphenation, standard features and additional goodies. Tracing and the
    extensibility of code are also discussed.
