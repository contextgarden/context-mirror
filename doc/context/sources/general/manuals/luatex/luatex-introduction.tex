\startchapter[title=Introduction]

This book will eventually become the reference manual of \LUATEX. At the moment,
it simply reports the behavior of the executable matching the snapshot or beta
release date in the title page.

Features may come and go. The current version of \LUATEX\ can be used for
production (in fact it is used in production by the authors) but users cannot
depend on complete stability, nor on functionality staying the same. This means
that when you update your binary, you also need to check if something fundamental
has changed. Normally this is communicated in articles or messages to a mailing
list. We're still not at version 1 but when we reach that state the interface
will be stable. Of course we then can decide to move towards version 2 with
different properties.

Don't expect \LUATEX\ to behave the same as \PDFTEX ! Although the core
functionality of that 8 bit engine is present, \LUATEX\ can behave different due
to not only its 32 bit character: there is native \UTF\ input, support for wide
fonts, and the math machinery is tuned for \OPENTYPE\ math. Also, the log output
can differ (and will likely differ more as we move forward).

\LUATEX\ consists of a number of interrelated but (still) distinguishable parts.
The organization of the source code is adapted so that it cna glue all these
components together. We continue cleaning up side effects of the accumulated
code in \TEX\ engines (especially code that is not needed any longer).

    \startitem
        Most of \PDFTEX\ version 1.40.9, converted to C (with patches from later
        releases). Some experimental features have been removed and some utility
        macros are not inherited as their functionality can be done in \LUA. We
        still use the \type {\pdf*} primitive namespace.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        The direction model and some other bits from \ALEPH\ RC4 (derived from
        \OMEGA) is included. The related primitives are part of core \LUATEX.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        We currently use \LUA\ 5.2.*. At some point we might decide to move to
        5.3.* but that is yet to be decided.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        There are few \LUA\ libraries that we consider part of the core \LUA\
        machinery.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        There are additional \LUA\ libraries that interface to the internals of
        \TEX.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        There are various \TEX\ extensions but only those that cannot be done
        using the \LUA\ interfaces.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        The fontloader uses parts of \FONTFORGE\ 2008.11.17 combined with
        additionaL code specific for usage in a \TEX\ engine.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        the \METAPOST\ library
    \stopitem
\stopitemize

Neither \ALEPH's I/O translation processes, nor tcx files, nor \ENCTEX\ can be
used, these encoding|-|related functions are superseded by a \LUA|-|based
solution (reader callbacks).

The yearly \TEXLIVE\ version is the stable version, any version between them is
considered beta. Keep in mind that new (or changed) features also need to be
reflected in the macro package that you use.
