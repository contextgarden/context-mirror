\startchapter[title=Introduction]

This manual is not a systematic discussion about math in \CONTEXT\ but more a
collection of wrap|-|ups. The file also serves as testcase. The content can
change over time and can also serve as a trigger for discussions on the mailing
list. Content gets added sort of random. Suggestions are welcome.

We discuss high level as well as low level commands. Some of the low level
commands (primitives) are wrapped in high level commands but you can of course
always revert to bare \TEX.

I won't go into much detail about typesetting beautiful math, for that I refer to
the \TEX book. \footnote {The most beautiful math is not typeset by \TEX\ anyway:
just search on YouTube for \quotation {Mathematics} by Hollie McNish, the
Metropole Orkest (conducted by Jules Buckley) and Martin Pyper.}
