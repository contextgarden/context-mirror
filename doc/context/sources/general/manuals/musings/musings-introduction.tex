\startchapter[title={Introduction}]

This is a collection of articles and wrap|-|ups that don't suit in other manuals
or collections. Some are published, some meant as draft for a presentation.

The \quotation {Children of \TEX} article is the framework for a presentation at
Bacho\TEX\ 2017 in Poland, and covers the main theme of the conference. In the
aftermath of that conference I wrote \quotation {Advertising \TEX} and later
\quotation {Why use \TEX?}. The 2018 Bacho\TEX\ conference theme is explored in
\quotation {What’s to stay, what’s to go}. After a short discussion on the
\CONTEXT\ mailing list about stability (at the moment that \MKII\ had been frozen
for more than a decade but is still used without problems) I wrote \quotation
{Stability}.

Many of the thoughts in these articles are influenced by discussions with my
colleagues Ton Otten and Kees van Marle. Operating in a similar arena, they
provide me the reflection needed to sort out my thoughts on these matters.
