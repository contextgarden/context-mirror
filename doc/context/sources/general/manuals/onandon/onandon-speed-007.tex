    Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of
    the great {\bf stupid} moves of all time. Hunter|-|gatherers have thousands of wild
    sources of food to subsist on. Agriculture changed that all, generating an
    overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you
    extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next
    potato blight. Agriculture allowed for stockpiling of surplus resources and thus,
    {\bf inevitably}, the unequal stockpiling of them --- stratification of society and
    the invention of classes. Thus, it allowed for the invention of poverty. I think
    that the punch line of the primate|-|human difference is that when humans
    invented poverty, they came up with a way of subjugating the low|-|ranking like
    {\bf nothing ever seen before} in the primate world.
