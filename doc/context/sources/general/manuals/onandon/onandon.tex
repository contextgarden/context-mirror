% comment   : Because this manual is distributed with TeX distributions it comes with a rather
%             liberal license. We try to adapt these documents to upgrades in the (sub)systems
%             that they describe. Using parts of the content otherwise can therefore conflict
%             with existing functionality and we cannot be held responsible for that. Many of
%             the manuals contain characteristic graphics and personal notes or examples that
%             make no sense when used out-of-context.
%
% comment   : Some chapters have been published in TugBoat, the NTG Maps, the ConTeXt Group
%             journal or otherwise. Thanks to the editors for corrections.

% Timestamp: I started this document in the week https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFWz_6hnAEI
% showed up --- and there's more of this bbc performance --- it's this kind of the stuff that
% keeps me going 'on and on' .. Jacob C, Cory H, Snarky P, Jules B with orchestra ... it can't
% get any better I guess (although .. what would happen if we add Gavin H to that equation).
% And when looking at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5FqpddnJmc ... it's the kind of innovation
% in music that reminds me of first hearing Kate Bush (equally young when she showed up).
