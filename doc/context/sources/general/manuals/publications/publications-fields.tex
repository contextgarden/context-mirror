\cindex {showbtxdatasetfields}The field names for each entry \Index {category}
are colored according to their status with respect to the bibliography rendering
style. The \index {field+required}\quote {required} field names are colored in
green, where required means that if this field is missing, one is probably not
using the correct entry type or category. Some fields are \index
{field+optional}\quote {optional} (and some \index {field+required}\quote
{required} fields can become conditionally optional, see below). Fields that
normally would be \index {field+ignored}ignored (defined as neither required, nor
optional) are colored in dark yellow. Some fields are treated as \index
{field+special}\quote {special}, that is are used internally, not necessarily
directly rendered, and are colored here in blue.
