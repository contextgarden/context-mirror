\CONTEXT\ support the \BIBTEX\ way of managing article and book references. The data
is stored in a \type{.bib} file. A data entry in a \BIBTEX\ data file could be:

\startbuffer
@INBOOK{book01,
   author = "Jonker, J.",
   title = "From Hasselt to America",
   publisher = "Bookplan Publishers",
   year = "2012",
   chapter = "1.2",
}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

After loading the database with \type{\setupbibtex[database=hasseltbook]} the following
command is available:

\setupbibtex[database={hasseltbook},sort=author]
\setuppublications[refcommand=authoryear]

\startbuffer
Please refer to \cite[book01] for more information on famous people
that were born in Hasselt.
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Which would produce:

\getbuffer

In an appendix you can place the complete book list with:

\startbuffer
\placepublications[criterium=text]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

At this moment (2013 -- 2014) the bibliography mechanism is being completely
overhauled, so please visit the \goto {\CONTEXTWIKI} [ url
(http://wiki.contextgarden.net) ] and the \goto {Pragma ADE website} [ url
(http://www.pragma-ade.com/overview.htm) ] regularly for information.
