\project ma-cb

Here we summarize the commands we introduced in the previous chapters. This is
just a selection of the whole repertoire of \CONTEXT\ commands. Those who want to
see them all can take a look at the more extensive manual or the {\em Quick
Reference Manuals} that give a complete overview of all \CONTEXT||commands.

Arguments that are typeset {\sl slanted} are optional and can be omited. The
number points to the page where the command is explained. Black arrows indicate
that the command is only of use in interactive documents and gray arrows tell us
that additional functionality is provided in interactive mode. Keep in mind that
we only show the commands we described in this manual, there are many more.
