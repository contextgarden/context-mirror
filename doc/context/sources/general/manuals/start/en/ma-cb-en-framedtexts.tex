\placeintermezzo[here][block:bridge]{An intermezzo.}
\startframedtext
  It was essential for Hasselt to have a bridge across the Zwarte
  Water river. The bishop of Utrecht gave Hasselt his consent in
  1486.
  \blank
  Other cities in the neighbourhood of Hasselt were afraid of the
  toll money to be paid when crossing this bridge so they
  prevented the construction for many years.
\stopframedtext
\stopbuffer

Let's give an example:

\typebuffer

This example also illustrates the command \type{\definefloat}. You can find more
information on this command in \in{paragraph}[floatingblocks]. The \type{\blank}
is necessary to enforce a blank line.
