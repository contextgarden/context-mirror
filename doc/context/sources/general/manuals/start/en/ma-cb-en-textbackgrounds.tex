\Command{\tex{starttextbackground}}

To emphasize a paragraph you can use backgrounds. A background is set with the
command pair:

\shortsetup{starttextbackground}

An example can illustrate the use:

\startbuffer
\setuptextbackground
  [corner=round,frame=on,
   location=paragraph,
   leftoffset=.5\bodyfontsize,
   rightoffset=.5\bodyfontsize,
   bottomoffset=5pt]

\starttextbackground
Hasselt has produced a number of well known people. Only recently
it turned out that Kilian van Rensselaer played a prominent role
in the foundation of the State of New York.
\stoptextbackground
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This would be displayed as:

\getbuffer

Backgrounds can span multiple pages.

You can vary the display of the backgrounds with:

\shortsetup{setuptextbackground}

You can even define your own text backgrounds with:

\shortsetup{definetextbackground}
