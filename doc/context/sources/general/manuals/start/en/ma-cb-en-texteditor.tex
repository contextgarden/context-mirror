\startchapter[reference=texteditor,title=The \SCITE\ text editor]

The developers of \CONTEXT\ have always been able to proces their \TEX\ files
from a text editor. In that way \CONTEXT\ became an effective authoring tool.

At this moment the text editors \SCITE\ and \TEXWORKS\ are more or less part of
the \CONTEXT\ distribution.

Please refer to the \goto {\CONTEXTWIKI} [ url (http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Windows_Installation:_ConTeXt_Suite_with_SciTe) ]
and learn how to install \SCITE.

\SCITE\ supports the:

\startitemize[packed]
\item processing \TEX\ of files
\item colored display of commands (lexing)
\item syntax checking of \TEX, \XML\ and \LUA\ files
\item spell checking of your text
\stopitemize

The \CONTEXT\ specific support of \SCITE\ is described in the manual \goto
{\SCITE\ in \CONTEXT} [ url (manual:scite) ].
