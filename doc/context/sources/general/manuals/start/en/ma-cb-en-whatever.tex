\startsection[title=A titlepage]

\index{titlepage}

\Command{\tex{startstandardmakeup}}
\Command{\tex{definemakeup}}
\Command{\tex{setupmakeup}}

In the first example of this manual on \at{page}[inputfile] we used the command:

\shortsetup{startnamemakeup}
%\shortsetup{start<<name>>makeup} % does not work

This command can be used to define titlepages. Such a command is needed since
title pages often have a different layout than that of the bodytext. With the
command pair \type{\start ... \stopstandardmakeup} you can make up a page within
the default page dimensions.

A simple titlepage may look like this:

\startbuffer
\startstandardmakeup
\blank
\rightaligned{\tfd Hasselt in the 21st century}
\blank
\rightaligned{\tfb The future}
\vfill
\rightaligned{\tfa C. van Marle}
\rightaligned{Hasselt, 2013}
\stopstandardmakeup
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

In a doublesided document you have to go through some additional actions to
typeset the back of the titlepage.

\startbuffer
\startstandardmakeup[doublesided=no]
\blank
\rightaligned{\tfd Hasselt in the 21st century}
\blank
\rightaligned{\tfb The future}
\vfill
\rightaligned{\tfa C. van Marle}
\rightaligned{Hasselt, \currentdate[year]}
\stopstandardmakeup
\startstandardmakeup[page=no]
\vfill
\copyright \currentdate[year]

This book is dedicated to the people living in Hasselt. We
want to thank photographer J. Jonker for manipulating the
photos in this book in such a way that readers can get a
clear picture of Hasselt's future look.
\stopstandardmakeup
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Your own make ups can be made and set up with:

\shortsetup{definemakeup}

and

\shortsetup{setupmakeup}

Please refer to the \goto {\CONTEXTWIKI} [ url (http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Command/setupmakeup) ]
for more information on the \type{\start...\stopmakeup} command.

\stopsection

\startsection[reference=overlays,title=Overlays]

\index{overlay}

The overlay mechanism gives you the opportunity to add a specific layout
to a text component. When there is a background option in a \CONTEXT\ command
you can use overlays.

\startbuffer
\defineoverlay
    [verticalbar]
    [{\blackrule[height=2cm,width=.5cm,color=red]}]

\defineoverlay
    [horizontalbar]
    [{\blackrule[height=.5cm,width=12cm,color=red]}]

\framed
  [width=12cm,
   height=6cm,
   background={color,foreground,verticalbar,horizontalbar},
   offset=overlay,
   backgroundcolor=blue,
   frame=off]
  {\blackrule[width=12cm,height=2cm,color=white]}
\stopbuffer

The flag of Hasselt could be defined with framed and a number of overlays:

\typebuffer

This will become:

\startlinecorrection
\getbuffer
\stoplinecorrection

The pagenumber in this manual has a background with an overlay where the
\type{\MPclipFive} command takes care of drawing the image with \METAPOST.

\startbuffer
\defineoverlay
  [NumberBackground]
  [\MPclipFive{\overlaywidth}{\overlayheight}{30pt}{5pt}]

\setuppagenumbering
  [\location={footer,middle},
   \command=\NummerCommand]

\def\NummerCommand#1%
  {\framed
     [\background=NumberBackground,
      \frame=off,
      \offset=6pt]
     {\lower.5\dp\strutbox\hbox spread 60pt{\hss#1\hss}}}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

\stopsection

\startsection[reference=setups,title=Setups]

\index{setups}

\Command{\tex{setup}}

While defining the layout of a document you can define setups
with \type{\start...\stopsetups}. Setups are placed in the setup area of
input file and mostly used to combine a number of commands.

\startbuffer
\startsetups colorize
    \blue
\stopsetups

\startsetups decolorize
    \black
\stopsetups

\setupitemize
    [before=\setups{colorize},
     after=\setups{decolorize}]

Some data on the church are:

\startitemize[packed,3*broad]
\sym{997}  mentioned for the first time
\sym{1380} destroyed by fire
\sym{1466} rebuild
\sym{1657} restored after shelling by enemy troops
\sym{1725} struck by lightning
\stopitemize

\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Which would result in:

\start % AFO: to keep color and distance local
\getbuffer
\stop

Another way of invoking the setups is by the \type{setups} option
that comes with some \CONTEXT\ commands:

\startbuffer
\definestartstop[remark]

\setupstartstop[remark]
  [before=\startframed,
   after=\stopframed]

\startsetups important
  \inleftmargin
    [scope=local,
     hoffset=1em]{\bf\color[blue]{â†’}}
\stopsetups

\setupframed
  [align=normal,
   setups=important,
   frame=on,
   framecolor=blue,
   offset=5pt]

\startremark
  The Stephanus Church was built in 997. After an enormous
  fire in 1380 it was rebuilt and that's why it has Gothic
  features. The rebuilding was finished in 1466.\endgraf
\stopremark
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This becomes:

\blank

\start
\getbuffer
\stop

\stopsection

\startsection[reference=variables,title=Variables]

\index{variables}

\Command{\tex{getvariable}}
\Command{\tex{setvariables}}

There is a mechanism in \CONTEXT\ that enables you to compact information in a
list of variables that you can recall throughout the document.

\shortsetup{setvariables}

The example below shows how to use variables in defining a coverpage.

\startbuffer
\setvariables
  [cover]
  [set=\setups{coverpage},
   student=no,
   teacher=yes,
   title=From Hasselt to America,
   subtitle=An Odyssey,
   authors=\setup{allauthors},
   edition=2012,
   isbn=0123456789]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

The moment you need the title on your cover page (or somewhere else in your document) you can
summon it by:

\startbuffer
\getvariable{cover}{title}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

\stopsection

\startsection[reference=floatingblocks,title=Floating blocks]

\index{floating blocks}
\index{postponing a block}

\Command{\tex{definefloat}}
\Command{\tex{setupfloat}}
\Command{\tex{setupfloats}}
\Command{\tex{setupcaptions}}
\Command{\tex{placeintermezzo}}

A block in \CONTEXT\ is a text element, for example a table or a figure that you
can process in a special way. You have already seen the use of
\type{\placefigure} and \type{\placetable}. These are both examples of floating
blocks. The floating mechanism is described in \in{chapter}[figures] and
\in[tables].

You can define these kind of blocks yourself with:

\shortsetup{definefloat}

The bracket pairs are used for the name in singular and
plural form. For example:

\starttyping
\definefloat[intermezzo][intermezzi]
\stoptyping

Now the following commands are available:

\starttyping
\placeintermezzo[][]{}{}
\startintermezzotext ... \stopintermezzotext
\placelistofintermezzi
\completelistofintermezzi
\stoptyping

The newly defined floating block can be set up with:

\shortsetup{setupfloat}

You can set up the layout of floating blocks with:

\shortsetup{setupfloats}

You can set up the numbering and the labels with:

\shortsetup{setupcaption}

These commands are typed in the set up area of your input file and will have a
global effect on all floating blocks.

\setupframedtexts
    [width=.8\makeupwidth,
     background=color,
     backgroundcolor=gray,
     corner=round,
     framecolor=blue,
     rulethickness=2pt]

\startbuffer
\setupfloat[intermezzo][location=middle]
\setupcaption[location=bottom,headstyle=boldslanted]

\placeintermezzo{An intermezzo.}
\startframedtext
At the beginning of this century there was a tram line from
Zwolle to Blokzijl via Hasselt. Other means of transport became
more important and just before the second world war the tram line
was stopped. Nowadays such a tram line would have been very
profitable.
\stopframedtext
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

\start
\getbuffer
\stop

The framed texts inherits its layout from the example \at{page}[block:bridge].

Tables or figures may take up a lot of space. The placing of these text elements
can be postponed till the next page break. This is done with:
\type{\start ... \stoppostponing}:

\startbuffer
\startpostponing
\placefigure
  {A postponed figure.}
  {\externalfigure[ma-cb-16][width=\textwidth]}
\stoppostponing
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

The figure will be placed at the top of the next page and will cause minimal
disruption of the running text.

\getbuffer

\startsection[title=Storing text for later use]

\index{storing text}

\Command{\tex{startbuffer}}
\Command{\tex{getbuffer}}
\Command{\tex{typebuffer}}
\Command{\tex{savebuffer}}
\Command{\tex{setupbuffer}}

You can store information temporarily for future use in your document with:

\shortsetup{startbuffer}

For example:

\starttyping
\startbuffer[visit]
If you want to see what Hasselt has in store you should come and
visit it some time. If you take this manual with you, you will
recognise some locations.
\stopbuffer

\getbuffer[visit]
\stoptyping

With \type{\getbuffer[visit]} you recall the stored text. The logical name is
optional. With \type{\typebuffer[visit]} you get back the typeset version of the
content of the buffer.

Buffers are set up with:

\shortsetup{setupbuffer}

You can also save a buffer to an external file with:

\shortsetup{savebuffer}

If you want to save the buffer \type{visit} in an external file called
\type{myfile-sightseeing.tmp} you type:

\starttyping
\savebuffer[visit][sightseeing]
\stoptyping

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Lines]

\index{lines}

\Command{\tex{hairline}}
\Command{\tex{starttextrule}}
\Command{\tex{thinrule}}
\Command{\tex{thinrules}}
\Command{\tex{setupthinrules}}
\Command{\tex{underbar}}
\Command{\tex{overstrikes}}
\Command{\tex{periods}}

There are many comands to draw lines. For a single line you type:

\shortsetup{hairline}

or:

\shortsetup{thinrule}

For more lines you type:

\shortsetup{thinrules}

Text in combination with lines is also possible:

\startbuffer
\starttextrule{Hasselt -- Amsterdam}
If you draw a straight line from Hasselt to Amsterdam you would have
to cover a distance of almost 145 \unit{Kilo Meter}.
\stoptextrule

If you draw two straight lines from Hasselt to Amsterdam you would
have to cover a distance of almost 290 \unit{Kilo Meter}.

Amsterdam \thinrules[n=3] Hasselt
\stopbuffer

\getbuffer

The code of this example is:

\typebuffer

You always have to be careful in drawing lines. Empty lines around
\type{\thinrules} must not be forgotten and the vertical spacing is always a
point of concern.

You can set up line spacing with:

\shortsetup{setupthinrules}

There are a few complementary commands that might be very
useful.

\shortsetup{setupfillinrules}

These commands are introduced in the examples below:

\startbuffer
\setupfillinrules[width=2cm]
\setupfillinlines[width=3cm]

\fillinrules[n=1]{\bf name}
\fillinrules[n=3]{\bf adress}

\fillinline{Can you please state the \underbar{number} of houses
            in Hasselt.} \par

Strike out \overstrikes{Hasselt in this text}\periods[18]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This will become:

\getbuffer

These commands are used in questionaires. Text that is
struck out or underlined will not be hyphenated.

In \in{section}[overlays] you have already seen the use of the
\type{\blackrule} command that can be set up with:

\shortsetup{setupblackrules}

\startbuffer
\blank
\blackrule[width=\textwidth,height=1cm,color=blue]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This will result in a rather fat line:

\getbuffer


\stopsection

\startsection[title=Super- and subscript in text]

\index{subscript}
\index{superscript}

\Command{\tex{low}}
\Command{\tex{high}}
\Command{\tex{lohi}}

\startbuffer
Hasselt's economy has known its \high{ups} and \low{downs}.
Since the nineties of the last century its economy is
\lohi{so}{so}.
\stopbuffer

\getbuffer

This ugly text was made with \type{\low{}}, \type{\high{}} and \type{\lohi{}{}}.
The text was placed between the curly braces.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Date]

\index{date}

\Command{\tex{currentdate}}

You can invoke the system date in your text with:

\shortsetup{currentdate}

With \type{\currentdate[day]}, \type{\currentdate[month]} and \type{\currentdate[year]} you can
invoke day, month and year separately.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Rotating text, figures and tables]

\index{rotating}

\Command{\tex{rotate}}

Sometimes you may want to rotate text or images. You can rotate
text and other objects with:

\shortsetup{rotate}

The first bracket pair is optional. Within that bracket pair
you specify the rotation: \type{rotation=90}. The curly
braces contain the text or object you want to rotate.

\startbuffer
Hasselt got its municipal rights in 1252. From that time on it had
the \rotate[rotation=90]{right} to use its own seal on official
documents. This seal showed Holy Stephanus known as one of the first
Christian martyrs, and was the \rotate[rotation=270]{patron} of
Hasselt. After the Reformation the seal was redesigned and Stephanus
lost his \quote{holiness} and was from that time on depicted without
his aureole.
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This results in a very ugly paragraph:

\getbuffer

You can rotate an image just as easily:

%  \placetable[rotate][]{}{}

\startbuffer
\placefigure
  [][fig:rotation]
  {The 180 \unit{Degrees} rotated fishing port (de Vispoort).}
  {\rotate[rotation=180]{\externalfigure[ma-cb-15][width=10cm]}}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

You can see in \in{figure}[fig:rotation] that it is not always clear what you get
when you rotate.

\getbuffer

We can set up rotating with:

\shortsetup{setuprotate}

In the example above you could also rotate image and caption by:

\startbuffer
\placefigure
  [180][fig:rotation]
  {The 180 \unit{Degrees} rotated fishing port (de Vispoort).}
  {\externalfigure[ma-cb-15][width=10cm]}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Scaling text]

\index{scaling}

\Command{\tex{scale}}
\Command{\tex{setupscale}}

For some obscure reasons you may want to scale text. You can scale text and other
objects with:

\shortsetup{scale}

\startbuffer
After 1810 the Dedemsvaart brought some prosperity to Hasselt. All
ships went through the canals of Hasselt and the \scale[factor=10]{shops} on both
sides of the canals \scale[factor=10]{prospered}.
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Which will result in:

\getbuffer

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Space]

\index{space}
\index{tilde}
\index{non-breakable space}

\Command{\tex{space}}
\Command{\tex{fixedspaces}}

The command \type{\space} will produce a space. In \CONTEXT\ the
\type{~} (tilde) is a non-breakable space.

\startbuffer
The Ridderstraat in Hasselt is about 160~m long and 5 to 6~m wide
with houses on both sides of the street.
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Tildes can also be used to align numbers in a row. The command
\type{\fixedspaces} will give the tilde the fixed width of a number.

\startbuffer
\fixedspaces

\bTABLE[frame=off]
\bTR \bTD Ridderstraat  \eTD \bTD 160 m \eTD \eTR
\bTR \bTD Prinsengracht \eTD \bTD 240 m \eTD \eTR
\bTR \bTD Kalverstraat  \eTD \bTD ~60 m \eTD \eTR
\bTR \bTD Meestersteeg  \eTD \bTD ~45 m \eTD \eTR
\eTABLE
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Carriage return]

\index{carriage return}

\Command{\tex{crlf}}
\Command{\tex{startlines}}

A new line can be enforced with:

\shortsetup{crlf}

As a \CONTEXT\ user you should use this command only as a last resort.

When a number of lines should be followed by a {\em carriage return and line feed}
you can use:

\shortsetup{startlines}

\starttyping
\startlines
.
.
.
\stoplines
\stoptyping

\startbuffer
On a wooden panel in the town hall of Hasselt you can read:

\startlines
Heimelijcken haet
eigen baet
jongen raet
Door diese drie wilt verstaen
is het Roomsche Rijck vergaen.
\stoplines

This little rhyme contains a warning for the magistrates of
Hasselt: don't allow personal benefits or feelings to
influence your wisdom in decision making.
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This will become:

\getbuffer

In a few commands new lines are generated by \type{\\}. For example if you type
\type{\inmargin{in the\\margin}} then the text will be divided over two lines.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Hyphenation]

\index{hyphenation}
\index{language}

\Command{\tex{mainlanguage}}
\Command{\tex{language}}
\Command{\tex{nl}}
\Command{\tex{en}}

When writing multi-lingual texts you have to be aware of the fact that
hyphenation may differ from one language to another.

To activate a language you type:

\shortsetup{mainlanguage}

Between the brackets you fill in
\type{af},
\type{ca},
\type{cs},
\type{cs},
\type{da},
\type{de},
\type{en},
\type{fi},
\type{fr},
\type{it},
\type{la},
\type{nl},
\type{nb},
\type{nn},
\type{pl},
\type{pt},
\type{es},
\type{sv} and
\type{tr} for
afrikaans,
catalan,
czech,
slovak,
danish,
german,
english,
finnish,
french,
italian,
latin,
dutch,
bokmal,
nnynorsk,
polish,
portuguese,
spanish,
swedish and
turkish respectively.

To change from one language to another you can use:

\starttyping
\language[nl] \language[en] \language[de] \language[fr] \language[sp] ...
\stoptyping

or the shorthand versions:

\starttyping
\nl  \en  \de  \fr  \sp ...
\stoptyping

An example:

\startbuffer
If you want to know more about Hasselt, the best book to read is
probably \quote{\nl Uit de geschiedenis van Hasselt} by
F.~Peereboom.
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

\getbuffer

If a word is wrongly hyphenated you can define the hyphenation points yourself.
This is done in the set up area of your input file:

\startbuffer
\hyphenation{his-to-ry}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Note that the language setting is also responsible for the way quotes are placed
around quotes and quotations (see \in{section}[quotations]).

In some languages (like Dutch) compound words are used that are connected with a
hyphen. The separate words have to be hyphenated correctly. In order to do that
you can use \type{||}.

\startbuffer
If your looking for an English||speaking person in Hasselt you should
go to the Tourist Information Office. There you may expect to find
full|| and part||time employees who are fluent in German, English,
French and of course Dutch.
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This will become:

\getbuffer

The double \type{||} takes care of the hyphen and the correct hyphenation of the
separate words. Also note the suspended compounds.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Charts]

\index{chart}

\Command{\tex{FLOWchart}}

To enable you to draw flow diagrams \CONTEXT\ contains the core module
\type{chart}. A simple organogram may look like this:

\startbuffer
\setupFLOWcharts
  [width=9\bodyfontsize,
   height=2\bodyfontsize,
   dx=1\bodyfontsize,
   dy=1\bodyfontsize]

\setupFLOWlines
  [arrow=no]

\startFLOWchart[organogram]
  \startFLOWcell
    \shape    {action}
    \name     {01}
    \location {2,1}
    \text     {Zwartewaterland}
    \connect  [bt]{02}
    \connect  [bt]{03}
    \connect  [bt]{04}
  \stopFLOWcell
  \startFLOWcell
    \shape    {action}
    \name     {02}
    \location {1,2}
    \text     {Hasselt}
  \stopFLOWcell
  \startFLOWcell
    \shape    {action}
    \name     {03}
    \location {2,2}
    \text     {Zwartsluis}
  \stopFLOWcell
  \startFLOWcell
    \shape    {action}
    \name     {04}
    \location {3,2}
    \text     {Genemuiden}
  \stopFLOWcell
\stopFLOWchart
\stopbuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer\FLOWchart[organogram]}

This diagram is defined with the commands below:

\typebuffer

It is of good practice to define your setups and flow diagrams in separate
definition files (environments).

\startbuffer
\FLOWchart[organogram]
\stopbuffer

The flowchart can then be invoked by:

\typebuffer

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Comment in input file]

\index{comment}
\index[percent]{\% in input file}

All text between \type{\start...\stoptext} will be processed while running
\CONTEXT. Sometimes however you may have text fragments you don't want to be
processed or you want to comment on your \CONTEXT\ commands.

If you preceed your text with the percentage sign \type{%}
it will not be processed.

\startbuffer
% In very big documents you can use the command \input for
% different files.
%
% For example:
%
% \input hass01.tex  % chapter 1 on Hasselt
% \input hass02.tex  % chapter 2 on Hasselt
% \input hass03.tex  % chapter 3 on Hasselt
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

When you delete the \type{%} before \type{\input} the three files will be
processed. The comment describing the contents of the files will not be
processed.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Notes]

\index{note}

\Command{\tex{startcomment}}

If you want your comment in the input file visible as a 'note' in the PDF file
you can use:

\shortsetup{startcomment}

\startbuffer
\startcomment
    The image of the Vispoort should be in color.
\stopcomment
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

The command will produce a sticky note in the PDF.

The note is only visible when interactivity is set with \type{\setupinteraction}
and the comment with \type{\setupcomment}.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Hiding text]

\index{hiding text}

\Command{\tex{starthiding}}

Text can be hidden with:

\shortsetup{starthiding}

The text between \type{\start ... \stophiding} will not be processed.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=Input of another {\tt tex} file]

\index{input other \TEX--files}

\Command{\tex{input}}

In a number of situations you may want to insert other \TEX\ files in your input
file. For example, sometimes it is more efficient to specify \CONTEXT\ sources in
more than one file in order to be able to partially process your files.

Another file (with the name \type{another.tex}) can be inserted by:

\starttyping
\input another.tex
\stoptyping

The extension is optional so this will work too:

\starttyping
\input another
\stoptyping

The command \type{\input} is a \TEX\ command.

For a more systematic approach in maintaining your documents \CONTEXT\ supports a
project structure with commands like \type{\start...\stopenvironment} and
\type{\start...\stopproduct}. Please refer to the magazine
\goto {\em Project structure} [ url(thisway:proj-struc) ]
for more information.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=XML (eXtended Markup Language)]

\index{xml}
\index{mathml}
\index{openmath}

Normally you code your document with \CONTEXT\ commands so you can tell \CONTEXT\
what to do with the coded text elements.

A more rigid way to code your content is \XML\ (eXtended Markup Language) which enables
you to have more control over your content (scripting, xslt, validation). A simple
\XML\ coded document could look like this:

\startbuffer
<?xml version='1.0' standalone='yes?>

<document>
  <section>
    <title>Hasselt in winter</title>
    <content>
      <p>In winter scating is a very popular sport in Hasselt.
         All over Hasselt the frozen canals offer children a great
         play ground.</p>
      <p>...</p>
    </content>
  </section>
</document>
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

\CONTEXT\ is able to deal with \XML\ directly without underlying XML2TEX
conversions. Please refer to the manual \goto {Dealing with XML} [ url
(manual:xml) ] for more information on how to process \XML\ documents.

\CONTEXT\ also supports \MATHML\ (presentational and content markup) and
\OPENMATH\ with which math expressions can be coded in \XML\ documents.
