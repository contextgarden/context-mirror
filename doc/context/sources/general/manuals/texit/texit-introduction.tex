I needed a place to collect examples of \TEX\ coding and this is it. The examples
presented here are an unorganized bunch. Some originate in questions asked on the
mailing list. Others are byproducts of tests made when playing with some (new)
functionality. When you plan to use \TEX\ for a long time, it doesn't hurt to see
a bit of \TEX\ coding but when possible I will also show the \CONTEXT\ way.

I hope that this document is useful. You can of course always try to challenge me
for more examples. Hopefully I will not forget about this document and extend it
occasionaly.
