This manual contains some information about features that can help you to manage
workflows or \CONTEXT\ related processes. Because we use \CONTEXT\ ourselves all
that we need ends up in the distribution. When you discover something workflow
related that is not yet covered here, you can tell me. I simply forget about all
there is, especially if it's made for projects. Don't expect this manual to be
complete or extensive, it's just a goodie.
