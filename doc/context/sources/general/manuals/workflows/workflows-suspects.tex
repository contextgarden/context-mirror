\startchapter[title={Suspects}]

When many authors and editors are involved there is the danger of inconsistent
spacing being applied. We're not only talking of the (often invisible in editing
programs) nobreak spaces, but also spacing inside or outside quotations and
before and after punctuation or around math.

In \CONTEXT\ we have a built||in suspects checker that you can enable with the
following command:

\starttyping
\enabletrackers[typesetters.suspects]
\stoptyping

The next table shows some identified suspects.

\starttexdefinition ShowSample #1
    \NC \type{#1}
    \NC \enabletrackers[typesetters.suspects]#1\disabletrackers[typesetters.spacing]
    \NC \NR
\stoptexdefinition

\starttabulate[|||][before=,after=]
    \ShowSample{foo$x$}
    \ShowSample{$x$bar}
    \ShowSample{foo$x$bar}
    \ShowSample{$f+o+o$:}
    \ShowSample{;$f+o+o$}
    \ShowSample{; bar}
    \ShowSample{foo:bar}
    \ShowSample{\quote{ foo }}
    \ShowSample{\quote{bar }}
    \ShowSample{\quote{ bar}}
    \ShowSample{(foo )}
    \ShowSample{\{foo \}}
    \ShowSample{foo{\bf gnu}bar}
    \ShowSample{foo{\it gnu}bar}
    \ShowSample{foo$x^2$bar}
    \ShowSample{foo\nobreakspace bar}
\stoptabulate

Of course this analysis is not perfect but we use it in final checking of complex
documents that are generated automatically from \XML. \footnote {Think of math
school books where each book is assembled from over a thousands files.}
