Hi,

The build script produce efficient static binaries with only a couple of system libraries as
dependency. ConTeXt will not depend on anything else than provided here. Lua is the extension
language to be used and that has worked well for quite a while now.

The build script that is provided will compile under ./build so you might want to make a copy
of the source tree to a suitable place that you can wipe after the job is done. The script
accepts only a few command line arguments.

  build.sh :

  --native    build/native    meant for unix (linux, freebsd, openbsd, osx, arm)
  --mingw-32  build/mingw-32  meant for 32 bit windows (crosscompiled)
  --mingw-64  build/mingw-64  meant for 64 bit windows (crosscompiled)

I develop LuaMetaTeX on Windows and use WLS (with OpenSuse) for cross compilation as well as
native Linux binaries. Editing is done in Visual Studio with the exception of the MetaPost
CWeb files for which I use SciTE.

Because we use CMake, you can compile using the MSVC compiler as well as CLang. Currently the
MingW crosscompiled binaries are slightly faster, next come the native ones, but till now
CLang lags behind. The native compiler produces the smallest binaries and compiles fastest.

  build.cmd :

    --x64      build/msvc-cmd-x64    meant for 64 bit windows using intel/amd chips
    --x32      build/msvc-cmd-x86    meant for 32 bit windows using intel/amd chips
    --arm64    build/msvc-cmd-arm64  meant for 64 bit windows using arm chips

Alternatively you can run a build job from Visual Studio. Of course it only works well if you
have the right compilers installed which is easy to do from the user interface. All settings
happen in CMakeLists.txt so you have to load that one.

Support for LuaMetaTeX and ConTeXt is provided at the (dev-)context mailing lists and at the
ConTeXt Wiki. Binaries are available at:

    https://build.contextgarden.net/#/waterfall?tags=c.luametatex
    https://dl.contextgarden.net/build/luametatex

The first link shows the status, the second link is where the binaries can be downloaded.
