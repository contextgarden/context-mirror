%D Somewhere in 2001 I started collecting new functionality
%D in a module \type {m-yesno}. As the name suggests, I was
%D not entirely sure if this functionality belonged in the
%D kernel. When (again) on the \CONTEXT\ list a request for
%D side bars was posted, I decided to move such code to plus
%D modules. Users who want this additional functionality can
%D put the following call in their \type {cont-sys.tex} file:
%D
%D \starttyping
%D \usemodule[plus]
%D \stoptyping

% \readfile {plus-rul} \donothing \donothing
% \readfile {page-str} \donothing \donothing
% \readfile {page-plg} \donothing \donothing

\endinput
