%D These macros were first needed by Frits (Gajes) Spijker
%D (of the Math4All project that we participate in), and used
%D for typesetting the minus sign that is keyed into scientific
%D calculators. We use the monospaced signs, that we also define
%D as symbol, so that they can be overloaded.

%D How negative such a symbol looks is demonstrated in:
%D $\negative 10^{\negative 10^{\negative 10}}$.
