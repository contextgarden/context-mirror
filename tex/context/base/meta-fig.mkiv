%D This module implements a method for defining
%D stand||alone||graphics, that is, each graphic gets is own
%D page. Because graphics are wrapped in a \type {\framed},
%D you can add overlays to the graphic directly, and since the
%D whole \CONTEXT\ machinery is available, you can also add
%D page backgrounds.

%D Although this is hardly of any use, you can mix these
%D definitions with the text flow, since all settings are
%D kept local. The page is clipped to the image size.
