%C This module is part of the \CONTEXT\ macro||package and is
%C therefore copyrighted by \PRAGMA. See mreadme.pdf for
%C details.

%D We can experiment here with runtime loading, i.e. no longer
%D use a format. However, we still need a stub then but it could
%D as well be luatools (mtxrun) itself then.

%D This format is just a minimal layer on top of the \LUATEX\
%D engine and will not provide high level functionality. It can
%D be used as basis for dedicated (specialized) macro packages.
%D
%D A format is generated with the command;
%D
%D \starttyping
%D mtxrun --script metatex --make
%D \stoptyping
%D
%D For the moment this is a placeholder. Maybe some day ... the old
%D file history/metatex/metatex.tex so I can pick up from there if
%D needed.
