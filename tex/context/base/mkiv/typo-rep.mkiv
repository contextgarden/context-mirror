% experimental stripping

%D For a while we had stripping of special chars built into the analyzer
%D but Khaled suggested to generalize this so I changed the code into a
%D manipulator there.
%D
%D \starttyping
%D \definefontfeature[default][default][mode=node,formatters=strip]
%D \stoptyping
%D
%D However, in \MKIV\ it makes more sense to also provide it as a more
%D general feature. Here we implement this as experiment. I might
%D cook up a few more variants in both variants.
