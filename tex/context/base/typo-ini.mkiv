%C therefore copyrighted by \PRAGMA. See mreadme.pdf for
%C details.

%D Since \CONTEXT\ is dealing with typographics, isn't
%D September 2000 a bit late to start writing this module? It
%D may seem so, but since more and more languages are
%D supported, we think it is time to isolate language specific
%D typographic extensions in modules. The first language that
%D demands this is Chinese, and more will follow.

% %D The following switch can be used to signal macros that they

% %D \macros

% %D A stupid but useful macro.
