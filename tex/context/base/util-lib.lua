-- This is experimental code for Hans and Luigi. Don't depend on it! There
-- will be a plain variant.

--[[

The problem with library bindings is manyfold. They are of course platform
dependent and while a binary with its directly related libraries are often
easy to maintain and load, additional libraries can each have their demands.

One important aspect is that loading additional libraries from within the
loaded one is also operating system dependent. There can be shared libraries
elsewhere on the system and as there can be multiple libraries with the same
name but different usage and versioning there can be clashes. So there has to
be some logic in where to look for these sublibraries.

We found out that for instance on windows libraries are by default sought on
the parents path and then on the binary paths and these of course can be in
an out of our control, thereby enlarging the changes on a clash. A rather
safe solution for that to load the library on the path where it sits.

Another aspect is initialization. When you ask for a library t.e.x it will
try to initialize luaopen_t_e_x no matter if such an inializer is present.
However, because loading is configurable and in the case of luatex is already
partly under out control, this is easy to deal with. We only have to make
sure that we inform the loader that the library has been loaded so that
it won't load it twice.

In swiglib we have chosen for a clear organization and although one can use
variants normally in the tex directory structure predictability is more or
less the standard. For instance:

.../tex/texmf-mswin/bin/lib/luatex/lua/swiglib/mysql/core.dll
.../tex/texmf-mswin/bin/lib/luajittex/lua/swiglib/mysql/core.dll
.../tex/texmf-mswin/bin/lib/luatex/context/lua/swiglib/mysql/core.dll
.../tex/texmf-mswin/bin/lib/swiglib/lua/mysql/core.dll
.../tex/texmf-mswin/bin/lib/swiglib/lua/mysql/5.6/core.dll

The lookups are determined via an entry in texmfcnf.lua:

CLUAINPUTS = ".;$SELFAUTOLOC/lib/{$engine,luatex}/lua//",

A request for t.e.x is converted to t/e/x.dll or t/e/x.so depending on the
platform. Then we use the regular finder to locate the file in the tex
directory structure. Once located we goto the path where it sits, load the
file and return to the original path. We register as t.e.x in order to
prevent reloading and also because the base name is seldom unique.

The main function is a big one and evolved out of experiments that Luigi
Scarso and I conducted when playing with variants of SwigLib. The function
locates the library using the context mkiv resolver that operates on the
tds tree and if that doesn't work out well, the normal clib path is used.

The lookups is somewhat clever in the sense that it can deal with (optional)
versions and can fall back on non versioned alternatives if needed, either
or not using a wildcard lookup.

This code is experimental and by providing a special abstract loader (called
swiglib) we can start using the libraries.

A complication is that we might end up with a luajittex path matching before a
luatex path due to the path spec. One solution is to first check with the engine
prefixed. This could be prevented by a more strict lib pattern but that is not
always under our control. So, we first check for paths with engine in their name
and then without.

For convenience we make the require loader function swiglib aware. Alternatively
we could put the specific loader in the global namespace.

At the cost of some overhead we provide a specific loader so that we can keep
track of swiglib usage which is handy for development. In context this is the
recommended loader.

local swiglibs = { }

function swiglib(name,version)
    local library = swiglibs[name]

So, we now have:

local gm = require("swiglib.gmwand.core")
local gm = swiglib("gmwand.core")
local sq = swiglib("mysql.core")
local sq = swiglib("mysql.core","5.6")

Watch out, the last one is less explicit and lacks the swiglib prefix.
