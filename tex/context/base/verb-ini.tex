%C This module is part of the \CONTEXT\ macro||package and is
%C therefore copyrighted by \PRAGMA. Non||commercial use is
%C granted.

%D Because this module is quite independant of system macros,
%D it can be used as a stand||alone verbatim environment.
%D
%D This is a sort of second release of \type{supp-ver} and
%D therefore differs in some aspects from the implementation
%D published in the \MAPS. The first change concern
%D optimization of breaks, that is, the first and last two
%D lines of verbatim blocks are kept together. The second
%D adaption is due to the fact that I wanted to support pretty
%D printing not only for \TEX\ sources, but also for \PERL,
%D \METAPOST\ and probably more. The \JAVASCRIPT\ module is 
%D closely related to \PERL, so we will not mention that one 
%D again.

%D Verbatim typesetting, especially of \TEX\ sources, is a
%D non||trivial task. This is a direct results of the fact that
%D characters can have \CATCODES\ other than~11 and such
%D characters needs a special treatment. What for instance is
%D \TEX\ supposed to do when it encounters a \type{$} or an
%D \type{#}? This module deals with these matters.

\writestatus{loading}{Context Verbatim Macros / Initialization}

%D The verbatim environment has some features, like coloring
%D \TEX\ text, seldom found in other environments. Especially
%D when the output of \TEX\ is viewed on an electronic medium,
%D coloring has a positive influence on the readability of
%D \TEX\ sources, so we found it very acceptable to dedicate
%D half of this module to typesetting \TEX\ specific character
%D sequences in color. In this module we'll also present some
%D macro's for typesetting inline, display and file verbatim.
%D The macro's are capable of handling \TAB\ too.
%D
%D This module shows a few tricks that are often overseen by
%D novice, like the use of the \TEX\ primitive \type{\meaning}.
%D First I'll show in what way the users are confronted with
%D verbatim typesetting. Because we want to be able to test for
%D symmetry and because we hate the method of closing down the
%D verbatim mode with some strange active character, we will
%D use the following construction for display verbatim:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \starttyping
%D The Dutch word 'typen' stands for 'typing', therefore in the Dutch version
%D one will not find the word 'verbatim'.
%D \stoptyping
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D In \CONTEXT\ files can be typed with \type{\typefile} and
%D inline verbatim can be accomplished with \type{\type}. This
%D last command comes in many flavors:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D We can say \type<<something>> or \type{something}. The first one is a bit
%D longer but also supports slanted typing, which accomplished by typing
%D \type<<a <<slanted>> word>>. We can also use commands to enhance the text
%D \type<<with <</bf boldfaced>> text>>. Just to be complete, we decided
%D to accept also \LaTeX\ alike verbatim, which means that \type+something+
%D and \type|something| are valid commands too. Of course we want the grouped
%D alternatives to process \type{hello {\bf big} world} with braces.
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D In the core modules, we will build this support on top of
%D this module. There these commands can be tuned with
%D accompanying setup commands. There we can enable commands,
%D slanted typing, control spaces, \TAB||handling and (here we
%D are:) coloring. We can also setup surrounding white space
%D and indenting. Here we'll only show some examples.

%D \macros
%D   {verbatimfont}
%D   {}
%D
%D When we are typesetting verbatim we use a non||proportional
%D (mono spaced) font. Normally this font is available by
%D calling \type{\tt}. In \CONTEXT\ this command does a
%D complete font||style switch. There we could have stuck with
%D \type{\tttf}.

%D \macros
%D   {obeyedspace, obeyedtab, obeyedline, obeyedpage}
%D   {}
%D
%D We have followed Knuth in naming macros that make \SPACE,
%D \NEWLINE\ and \NEWPAGE\ active and assigning them
%D \type{\obeysomething}, but first we set some default values.

\def\obeyedspace {\hbox{ }}
\def\obeyedtab   {\obeyedspace}

\def\obeyedpage  {\vfill\eject}

%D \macros
%D   {controlspace,setcontrolspaces}
%D   {}
%D
%D First we define \type{\obeyspaces}. When we want visible
%D spaces (control spaces) we only have to adapt the definition
%D of \type{\obeyedspace} to:

\def\controlspace {\hbox{\char32}}

\bgroup

\egroup

%D \macros
%D   {obeytabs, obeylines, obeypages,
%D    ignoretabs, ignorelines, ignorepages}
%D   {}
%D
%D Next we take care of \NEWLINE\ and \NEWPAGE\ and because we
%D want to be able to typeset listings that contain \TAB, we
%D have to handle those too. Because we have to redefine the
%D \NEWPAGE\ character locally, we redefine the meaning of
%D this (often already) active character.

\catcode`\^^L=\@@active \def^^L{\par}

%D The following indirect definitions enable us to implement

%D

%D Although the inline verbatim commands presented here will be
%D extended and embedded in the core modules of \CONTEXT,
%D they can be used separately. Both grouped and character
%D alternatives are provided but \type{<<} and nested

%D takes one argument: the closing command.

%D One can define his own verbatim commands, which can be very

%D    \processinlineverbatim\egroup}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D Before entering inline verbatim mode, we take care of the
%D unwanted \TAB, \NEWLINE\ and \NEWPAGE\ characters and
%D turn them into \SPACE. We need the double \type{\bgroup}
%D construction to keep the closing command local.

%D Typesetting a file in most cases results in more than one
%D page. Because we don't want problems with files that are
%D read in during the construction of the page, we set
%D \type{\ifprocessingverbatim}, so the output routine can
%D adapt its behavior. Originally we used
%D \type{\scratchread}, but because we want to support nesting,
%D we decided to use a separate input file.

%D One day, a collegue asked me why I didn't prevent breaking

%D solution is possible: we just keep track of in what line
%D we are. One can turn this feature off.

%D \stoptypen

%D \def\BeginVerbatim {\bigskip \processdisplayverbatim{\EndVerbatim}}
%D \def\EndVerbatim   {\bigskip}
%D \stoptypen
%D

%D defining a closing command. If one is defined, the command
%D is executed after ending verbatim mode.

%D \type{\parskip}, because we don't want inter||paragraph
%D skips to creep into the verbatim source. Furthermore we
%D \type{\relax} the line||processing macro while getting the

%D \TEX\ does not offer \type{\everyline}, which is a direct

%D \type{\everyline} support.

%D \macros

%D   {}
%D
%D In this module we've reserved \type{\everypar} for the
%D things to be done with paragraphs and \type{\everyline} for
%D line specific actions. In \CONTEXT\ however, we use
%D \type{\everypar} for placing side- and columnfloats,
%D inhibiting indentation and some other purposes. In verbatim
%D mode, every line becomes a paragraph, which means that
%D \type{\everypar} is executed frequently. To be sure, the
%D user specific use of both \type{\everyline} and
%D \type{\everypar} is implemented by means of
%D \type{\EveryLine} and \type{\EveryPar}.
%D
%D We still have to take care of the \TAB. A \TAB\ takes eight
%D spaces and a \SPACE\ normally has a width of 0.5~em. Because
%D we can be halfway a tabulation, we must keep track of the
%D position. This takes time, especially when we print complete
%D files, therefore we \type{\relax} this mechanism by default.

%D One can use the different \type{\obeysomething} commands to
%D influence the behavior of these macro's. We use for instance
%D \type{\obeycharacters} for making \type{/} an active
%D character when we want to include typesetting commands.

%D The next part of this module deals with pretty printing. The
%D best way to understand how pretty verbatim typeseting works
%D is to take a look at the output produced by the \TEX, \PERL\
%D and \METAPOST\ modules first. Each of these modules has a
%D few setup macros that tag the individual characters with a
%D number that itself is associated to a interpretation macro.
%D A previous implementation linked characters (after making
%D them active) directly to such interpreters, but the more
%D indirect way makes it possible to inspect the next
%D character(s) without much expansion problems and/or
%D increasing run time.

%D By the way, \TEX\ defines \type{\+} as an outer macro, so we 
%D have to redefine this one to keep ourselves out of complaints.

\def\+{\tabalign}

%D Just to keep things consistant and to speed up some macros a
%D but, we define a few private constants.

\def\!!PRETTY      {PRETTY}

\def\!!prettyone   {prettyone}
\def\!!prettytwo   {prettytwo}
\def\!!prettythree {prettythree}
\def\!!prettyfour  {prettyfour}

%D The first step in defining a pretty interpreter is to assign
%D each character that needs special attention a number, like:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \setpretty \`A 21
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D Here the macro \type{\setpretty} makes the character
%D \type{A} active, and sets it meaning to the auxiliary macro
%D \type{\handleprettytoken}. This auxiliary macro takes the
%D character code (a number) and the interpretation number. The
%D three step implementation uses the \TEX book \type{~} trick.

\def\dodosetpretty%

\def\dosetpretty%
  {\afterassignment\dodosetpretty\!!counta}

\def\setpretty%
  {\afterassignment\dosetpretty\uccode`~=}

%D The macro \type{\handleprettytoken} is rather trivial and
%D calls for an interpreter macro.

\def\handleprettytoken#1%
  {\getvalue{\!!PRETTY#1}}

%D This interpreter is installed by saying
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \installprettyhandler 21 \SOMEprettyone
%D \stoptypen

\def\installprettyhandler#1 #2%
  {\letvalue{\!!PRETTY#1}#2}

%D Such an interpreter gets the character number:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \def\SOMEprettyone#1{...\getpretty{#1}...}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D where \type{\getpretty} equals \type{\char}. We can't
%D use \type{\let} here because we have to get rid of the
%D braces.

\def\getpretty#1%
  {\char#1}

%D Sometimes the action depends on the next token. This token
%D can be passed to the macro \type{\getprettydata}, that sets
%D \type{\prettytype} to the interpreter code. The character
%D code is saved in \type{\prettychar}.

\def\getprettydata#1%

      \global\chardef\prettychar=##2\relax}%
   \setbox0=\hbox{\global\chardef\prettychar=0#1}% expands #1 and ignores space
   \egroup}

\def\getpretties#1#2%
  {\char#1\bgroup\let\handleprettytoken=\getsecondpretty#2\egroup}

\def\getsecondpretty#1#2%
  {\char#2}

%D \type{\newpretty} and its associates.

%D In this example we see that the colors differ from what we
%D expect, but conform the definitions in the macro. This kind
%D of recoloring can be achieved by saying:
%D
%D \typebuffer
%D
%D We'll show some more examples:
%D
%D \startbuffer
%D %%\R{Red
%D %%\G\Green
%D %%\B[Blue
%D \stopbuffer
%D
%D {\newprettytrue\typebuffer}
%D
%D Watch the green \type{\Green}! This lines are specified as:
%D
%D \typebuffer
%D
%D When needed, one can use grouping.
%D
%D \startbuffer
%D {yes} %%\ B %%\{[ %%\}]
%D {no}
%D {no}  %%\ E
%D {yes}
%D \stopbuffer
%D
%D \typebuffer
%D
%D This leads to:
%D
%D {\newprettytrue\typebuffer}
%D
%D I won't explain the details of this mechanism. Those who
%D want to build their own pretty interpreters have to close
%D read the source anyway.
%D
%D Last we show an example of mixed pretty typesetting:
%D
%D \startbuffer
%D \ziezo{test}          %%\ P   ##\ B##\ T % enter PERL mode       %%\ E
%D if $test eq "test"    ##\ B   ##\ B##\ T % begin group (\bgroup) %%\ E
%D if $test eq "test";   ##\ T   %%\ B%%\ T % enter TEX mode        %%\ E
%D \ziezo{test}          %%\ M   %%\ B%%\ T % enter METAPOST mode   %%\ E
%D draw (0,0)--(10,10);  %%\ E   ##\ B##\ T % end group (\egroup)   %%\ E
%D if $test eq "test";
%D \stopbuffer
%D
%D \typebuffer
%D
%D Here we use \type{%%\ T}, \type{%%\ P} and \type{%%\ M} for
%D switching between \TEX, \PERL\ and \METAPOST\ mode.

%D When implementing new pretty macros, one only needs to
%D define something like:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \def\TEXtypezero%
%D   {\handlenewpretty\TEXtypethree}
%D \stoptypen

%D comments, but the final one also accepts double ones. The
%D main reason for this is that in \JAVA\ we have to deal with
%D \type{//}. Personally I prefer the double \type{%%} because
%D is stands out and is more symmetrical with the double
%D slash.

%D One may have noticed that the \type{\EveryPar} is only
%D executed once, because we consider each piece of verbatim
%D as one paragraph. When one wants to take the empty lines
%D into account, the following assignments are appropriate:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \EveryLine
%D   {\iflinepar
%D      \showparagraphcounter
%D    \fi
%D    \showlinecounter}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D In this case, nothing has to be assigned to \type{\EveryPar},
%D maybe except of just another extra numbering scheme. The
%D macros used to typeset this documentation are a bit more
%D complicated, because we have to take take 'long' margin
%D lists into account. When such a list exceeds the previous
%D pargraph we postpone placement of the paragraph number till
%D there's room. This way so it does not clash with the margin
%D words.

%D Normally such commands have to be embedded in a decent setup
%D structure, where options can be set at will.
%D
%D Now let's summarize the most important commands.
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \processinlineverbatim{\closingcommand}
%D \processdisplayverbatim{\closingcommand}
%D \processfileverbatim{filename}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D We can satisfy our own specific needs with the following
%D interfacing macro's:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \obeyspaces  \obeytabs  \obeylines  \obeypages  \obeycharacters
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D We can influence the verbatim environment with the following
%D macro:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \obeyemptylines
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D Some needs are fulfilled already with:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \setcontrolspace  \settabskips
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D lines can be enhanced with ornaments using:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \everypar  \everyline  \iflinepar
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D and pretty verbatim support is implemented by:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \beginofpretty[#1] ... \endofpretty
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D and some setup macro, like:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \setupprettyIDENTIFIERtype
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D The color support macro can be redefined by the user. The
%D parameter \type{#1} can be one of the four 'fixed'
%D identifiers {\em prettyone}, {\em prettytwo}, {\em
%D prettythree} and {\em prettyfour}. We have implemented a
%D more or less general PostScript color support mechanism,
%D using \type{specials}. One can toggle between color and
%D grayscale with:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \setgrayverbatim  \setcolorverbatim
%D \stoptypen

%D \macros
%D   {permitshiftedendofverbatim}
%D   {}
%D
%D We did not mention one drawback of the mechanism described
%D here. The closing command must start at the first position
%D of the line. In \CONTEXT\ we will not have this drawback,
%D because we can test if the end command is a substring of the
%D current line. The testing is done by two of the support
%D macros, which of course are not available in a stand alone
%D application of this module.
