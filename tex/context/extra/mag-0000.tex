\startbuffer[abstract] 
  This is the zero issue of a semi periodical. The
  associated style can be used by \CONTEXT\ users to
  typeset and publish their own issues.

This is the zero issue of a range of \CONTEXT\ related
publications, in most cases short introductions to new
functionality. The style may be used by users for providing
similar documents, but preferably not for other purposes,
since it may confuse readers in their expectations.  

We've chosen a layout which is more functional than
beautiful. This layout provides several text areas: headers
and footers, margins and edges as well as a main text area.
The surrounding (gray) makes the main page (which is
slightly smaller than A4) stand out and is suitable for
viewing in spread mode. 

The documents produced at \PRAGMA\ are called {\bf This
Way}, user documents gets the title {\bf My Way}. The
\PRAGMA\ issues are numbered. We strongly advise you not to
use the \type {mag-} prefix for your issues, since this may
lead to clashes with files distributed by \PRAGMA.
