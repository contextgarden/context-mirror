    Right from the start the ConTeXt user interface was sytematic enough to be described using a
    common framework. First it was done in the TeX language at the top of the files where features
    were implemented. Later we switched to XML where all definitions were moved to one file. That
    file could be translated to different user interfaces.

    The current XML files are a follow up on this. Instead of one big file we now have many small
    files, and support for shared (XML) definitions has been extended. Many more commands are defined,
    including those considered low level. There are no longer translated files needed but you can
    still generate them.

    These files can be used to generate overviews (see x-setups-*.mkiv) but also for generating
    information for text editors. We also use them for the (local) help service.
