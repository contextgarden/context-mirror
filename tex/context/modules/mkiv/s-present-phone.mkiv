%D The theme of Bacho\TeX\ was \quote {Getting \TEX\ out of the closet}. And, as I'm
%D always a bit sceptical about efforts to get a specialized toolbox like \TEX\
%D accepted in a large scale generic user base, I decided to give a talk dedicated
%D to Jerzy (the always optimistic organizer). (One can actually wonder if \TEX\ was
%D ever hidden in a closet.) And, because I had to get the attention of some nephew
%D and nieces I took there I gave the presentation without beamer but on my phone.
%D On such a device one just swipes but I still added two buttons. Watch the small
%D full|-|hd|-|ratio paper dimensions and 6 point font size.
