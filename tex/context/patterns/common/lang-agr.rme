% ==========================================
% This file was first created by mechanical translation from
% GRAhyph5.tex via "elhyph-utf8 -a -c" (version 0.1 by Peter
% Heslin -- p.j.heslin at durham dot ac dot uk). Some additions
% were also made by hand.
%
% Created by Dimitrios Filippou with some ideas borrowed from
% Yannis Haralambous, Kostis Dryllerakis and Claudio Beccari.
% Mojca Miklavec adapted it for the "hyph-utf8" package.
%
% These hyphenation patterns are explained in "ancient.pdf", which
% can be found in the "elhyphen" or "hyphenation-greek" package.
% Hyphenation examples are given in the file "anc-test.pdf", also
% to be found in the "elhyphen" or "hyphenation-greek" package.
% Questionable patterns are marked by three question marks "???".
%
% Documentation in English can be found in: D. Filippou,
% "Hyphenation patterns for Ancient and Modern Greek," in
% "TeX, XML, and Digital Typography" (A. Syropoulos et al.,
% eds.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3130, Springer-Verlag
% Berlin-Heidelberg, 2004. ISBN 3-540-22801-2.
