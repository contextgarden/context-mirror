%
% The macros used were created for ghyph31.tex by Bernd Raichle (see the
% German hyphenation pattern files for further details)
%
% This patterns have been created using standard, conservative
% hyphenation rules for catalan. The results have refined running them
% through patgen. In that way, the number of hits has been increased.
%
% These rules produce no wrong patterns (Results checked against the
% ``Diccionari Ortogr\`afic i de Pron\'uncia'', Enciclop\`edia
% Catalana. The percentage of valid hyphen misses is lower than 1%
%
% Some of the patterns below represent combinations that never
% happen in Catalan. We have tried to keep them to a minimum.
%
% *** IMPORTANT ***
% \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin should be set to 2 and 2
% respectively. If you set them below these values incorrect breaks
% will happen (specially at the beginning of foreign words and words
% which begin with some prefixes).
% *** IMPORTANT ***
%
% Please report any problem you might have to the authors!!!
