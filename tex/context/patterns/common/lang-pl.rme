% This is PLHYPH.TeX - the Polish hyphenation patterns
%          version 3.0a, Wednesday, May 17th, 1995
% to be used for the inclusion of Polish hyphenation patterns in any format,
% not necessarily in the MeX or LaMeX ones. The patterns are exactly
% the same as in the version 3.0 being the part of the MeX package,
% only the surrounding of the \pattern command is changed. The authors
% claim the upward compatibility, i.e., the version 3.0a can also be used
% with the MeX or LaMeX formats.

% The history of development of the Polish hyphenation patterns:
%
% The first version of the patterns was developed
% by Hanna Kołodziejska (1987).
%
% The adaptation to the LeX format (see below) and extensive modification
% were done by Bogusław Jackowski & Marek Ryćko (1987--1989).
%
% The hyphenation rules were further improved and adapted to the
% TeX 3.x requirements by Hanna Kołodziejska (1991).
%
% Lone-standing version (3.0a) of patterns was prepared (under pressure
% from LaTeX users) by Bogusław Jackowski and Marek Ryćko, following
% Mariusz Olko's suggestions, 1995.

% The LeX format mentioned above was the first version of the adaptation
% of TeX to the Polish language. The next version is called MeX.
