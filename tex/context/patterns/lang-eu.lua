% Hyphenation patterns for Basque.\
%\
% This file has first been written by Juan M. Aguirregabiria\
% (juanmari.aguirregabiria@ehu.es) on February 1997 based on the\
% shyphen.sh script that generates the Spanish patterns as compiled\
% by Julio Sanchez (jsanchez@gmv.es) on September 1991.\
%\
% In June 2008 the generating script has been rewritten into ruby and\
% adapted for native UTF-8 TeX engines. Patterns became part of hyph-utf8\
% package and were renamed from bahyph.tex into hyph-eu.tex.\
% Functionality should not change apart from adding ñ by default.\
%\
% The original Copyright followed and applied also to precessor of this file\

%\
% For more information about the new UTF-8 hyphenation patterns and\
