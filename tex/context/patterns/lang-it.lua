% semi-manual conversions of hyphenation patterns into UTF-8 in June 2008.\

%\
% The above mentioned file should become obsolete,\
% and the author of the original file should preferaby modify this file instead.\
%\
% Modificatios were needed in order to support native UTF-8 engines,\
% but functionality (hopefully) didn't change in any way, at least not intentionally.\
% This file is no longer stand-alone; at least for 8-bit engines\
% you probably want to use loadhyph-foo.tex (which will load this file) instead.\
%\
% Modifications were done by Jonathan Kew, Mojca Miklavec & Arthur Reutenauer\
% with help & support from:\
% - Karl Berry, who gave us free hands and all resources\
% - Taco Hoekwater, with useful macros\
% - Hans Hagen, who did the unicodifisation of patterns already long before\
%               and helped with testing, suggestions and bug reports\
% - Norbert Preining, who tested & integrated patterns into TeX Live\
%\
% However, the \"copyright/copyleft\" owner of patterns remains the original author.\
%\
% The copyright statement of this file is thus:\
%\
%    Do with this file whatever needs to be done in future for the sake of\
%    \"a better world\" as long as you respect the copyright of original file.\
%    If you're the original author of patterns or taking over a new revolution,\
%    plese remove all of the TUG comments & credits that we added here -\
%    you are the Queen / the King, we are only the servants.\
%\
% If you want to change this file, rather than uploading directly to CTAN,\
% we would be grateful if you could send it to us (http://tug.org/tex-hyphen)\
% or ask for credentials for SVN repository and commit it yourself;\
% we will then upload the whole \"package\" to CTAN.\
%\
% Before a new \"pattern-revolution\" starts,\
% please try to follow some guidelines if possible:\
%\
% - \\lccode is *forbidden*, and I really mean it\
% - all the patterns should be in UTF-8\
% - the only \"allowed\" TeX commands in this file are: \\patterns, \\hyphenation,\
%   and if you really cannot do without, also \\input and \\message\
% - in particular, please no \\catcode or \\lccode changes,\
%   they belong to loadhyph-foo.tex,\
%   and no \\lefthyphenmin and \\righthyphenmin,\
%   they have no influence here and belong elsewhere\
% - \\begingroup and/or \\endinput is not needed\
% - feel free to do whatever you want inside comments\
%\
% We know that TeX is extremely powerful, but give a stupid parser\
% at least a chance to read your patterns.\
