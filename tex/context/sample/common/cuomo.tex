Yeah, my mother is not expandable. And your mother is not expendable. And our
brothers and sisters are not expandable. And we're not going to accept a premise
that human life is disposable. And we're not going to put a dollar figure on
human life. First order of business is: save lives. Period. Whatever it costs.
Now, I also don't believe it's an either or. I believe you can have an
intelligent refined public health strategy. You talk about risk stratification.
You can have people go to work. You can test people and find out that they are
resolved from the virus. Let them go back to work. You can let go younger people
back to work. You can have an economic startup strategy that is consistent with a
public health strategy. It's smart. It's complicated. It's sophisticated. But
that's what government is supposed to do, right. That whole concept of developed
government policy and program. You can do both. But not in a clumsy ham-handed
way. Right? \quotation {Well, we'll just sacrifice old people, they're old people
anyway, and the old get left behind.} What is this? Some modern Darwinian theory
of natural selection? You can't keep up so the band is going to leave you behind.
We're gonna move on and if you can't keep up you, well then you just fall by the
wayside of life. God forbid.
