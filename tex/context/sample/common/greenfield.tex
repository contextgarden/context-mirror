But if you place a human brain, with its evolutionary mandate to adapt to its
environment, in an environment where there is no obvious linear sequence, where
facts can be accessed at random, where everything is reversible, where the gap
between stimulus and response is minimal, and above all where time is short, then
your train of thought could be derailed. Add in the sensory distractions of an
all|-|encompassing and vivid audio|-|visual universe encouraging shorter spans
for sustained attention, and you might become, as it were, a computer yourself: a
system responding efficiently and processing information very well, but devoid of
deeper thought.
