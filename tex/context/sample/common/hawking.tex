If [in 2600] you stacked all the new books being published next to
each other, you would have to move at ninety miles an hour just to
keep up with the end of the line. Of course, by 2600 new artistic
and scientific work will come in electronic forms, rather than as
physical books and paper. Nevertheless, if the exponential growth
continued, there would be ten papers a second in my kind of
theoretical physics, and no time to read them.
