The sample directory contains a few files with quotes that can be used
while testing styles.

I'll complete this file when I've reorganized my books and audio cd's.

If someone makes a nice bibtex file of these, the quotes can also be
used in testing bibliographic references and citations.

% Tufte: This quote will always produce hyphenated text, apart from the content,
% it's a pretty good test case for protruding.

% Reich: This is a list of the voice samples from Steve Reich's 1995 composition City Life.

% Ward: I should find a quote in the extremely well written Rare Earth as well. All Wards
% books excell.

% A Short History of Nearly Everything: I wish that I had the memory to remember this book
% verbatim.

% Chaos and Harmony: very nice and well written book, but the typography is rather bad:
% quite visible inter-character spacing in a text that can be typeset quite well by \TeX.

% The Universe in a Nutshell: a beautiful designed book, (companion of A Short History
% of Time).

% The World Without Us: A properly typeset, very readable book. Read it and you'll look at
% the world around you differently (and a bit more freightened).

% Dirt, The Erosion of Civilizations: one of those books that you buy immediately after
% reading a few sentences. Also one of those books that every politician should read.

% The Making of the Fittest: nice sample for color and subsentence testing. A very
% readable book but unfortunately it has inter-character spacing.

% The Schwarzenegger letter was originally typeset at a width equivalent to 16.1cm in
% a default ConTeXt setup.
