Had our solar system included two suns, the problem would have
involved three bodies (the two suns and each planet), and chaos
would have been immediately obvious. Planets would have had
erratic and unpredictable orbits, and creatures living on one
of these planets would never have been able to percieve the
slightest harmony. Nor would it have occurred to them that the
universe might be ruled by laws and that it is up to man's
intellect to discover them. Besides, it is not at all obvious
that life and conscience could even emerge in such a chaotic
system.
