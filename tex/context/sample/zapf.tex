Coming back to the use of typefaces in electronic
publishing: many of the new typographers receive their
knowledge and information about the rules of typography
from books, from computer magazines or the instruction
manuals which they get with the purchase of a PC or
software. There is not so much basic instruction, as of
now, as there was in the old days, showing the differences
between good and bad typographic design. Many people are
just fascinated by their PC's tricks, and think that a
widely||praised program, called up on the screen, will make
everything automatic from now on.
